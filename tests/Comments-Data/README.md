How Parent ID works:

-Parent ID represents which submission or comment the comment is directed
-If starts with t3 -> it's a submission with the following id
-if stats with t1 -> it's a comment with the folowind id

ex:
	* "parent_id": "t1_c5j3kkc" -> comment with id = c5j3kkc
	* "parent_id": "t3_xi6no" -> submission with id = xi6no
