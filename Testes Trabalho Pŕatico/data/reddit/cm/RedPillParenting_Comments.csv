It's just the social lives of those girls are so incredibly toxic and demanding- really taxing these girls at a time when they're establishing their morals.  A good strategy would be to find who is on the outs.  That is the girl who is in need of companionship, the girl who reluctantly sacrifices her dignity to fit in.  There's nothing predatory about seeking this girl out, in fact, a very meaningful relationship could come out of it.

Now, we have a family-couple that my wife and I are friends with.  Blue pill hell they are.  Kids run amuck, no leadership from dad, you name it.

So she starts trying to do this with my son.  He's all boy, a natural Alpha (unlike me at his age), a jock already.  They were over our house for a picnic and he came up to me and was like ""Dad, she's always just telling me what we should do, and sometimes I don't want to.  What do I say?""

So I told him ""You do what you want to do.  Don't ask her.  She might get mad, but watch, she'll come around.  If she gets mad, just walk away.  Who wants to hang out with someone like that anyway?""

He said he'd try it.

He did pretty good for a first time.  He'd flat out tell her ""Naw I don't want to do that."" and walk away.  Now she just mostly yells at him because she doesn't know what to say to a boy she can't boss around.

Nail on the head I think.

I have a 9 year old daughter that has been splitting time between me and the ex since she was 5 so I'll throw my couple of pennies in for what they are worth.

My daughter is very well behaved. Around me. I don't know what her discipline is like with her mother because I can't see it, but from what I am told by all accounts she is just as well behaved there as when she is with me. I have feared and still fear the influence that her mother will have on her, with that whole ""daughter of a single mother"" mindset she inherited from her mother that she got from her mother (I was starting to think it was genetic prior to TRP)

My daughter doesn't back talk, she isn't sassy with me/other adults/teachers, she is respectful, and much better behaved than any of her classmates. Yes I am bragging, I feel like I'm doing a damn good job. She is also a straight A student that was placed into the gifted program early on. Maybe I got lucky or maybe I put in the work.

How did I do it? Especially when her mother hopped on the carousel, got ""unhappy"", and brutally divorce raped me?

Well. For one thing I act like the man I want her to seek out. That also keeps me constantly improving me, because if there is one person on the planet I will not let myself fail, it is my child. There is my motivation.

She also looks a lot more like me than her mother, don't know if that is here or there, but it is still commented on ""No way you could deny that one!"" as if I'd want to. I have a good kid. I think this resemblance similarity has had some sort of weird effect where she identifies a little more with me. She has the build of my sister and the blond hair predominant in my family's Swedish genealogy. I think it helps, who knows.

Here is one big thing though. I make sure she learns how to do things for herself (beyond the basic kid chores). Not easy things, but things that regularly intimidate adults. At age 8 as her summer project? She assembled an entire computer for me, complete with blue LED lights, and installing windows 7 on an SSD correctly. I'm an IT guy and I'll be damned if some beta nerd is going to need to fix her computer. It gave her a ton of confidence, pride, and built her self-worth up. Exactly what I want.

I want her to value herself. I want her to not give herself away cheaply in the future. What better way than to teach her that she has value outside of her looks. And by all indications she is going to be the type that I'll be chasing dudes away from. She is the size of a 7 year old at 9, in the 1% for weight and height, and if she inherits the huge cans my mother has and couples it with the 5' nothing of my sister... fuck, why did I go there? I'll worry about that when and if it happens.

Because the point is that I teach her how to do things that aren't typically feminine. She is involved in a lot of my hobbies, at least the ones I deem appropriate for a 9 y.o. girl. We tumble rocks, use the diamond saw to cut them and a lapidary to cab them, and make jewelry out of them. She gets to learn a skill that can eventually earn her money (jewelry making), has to do a bunch of manual labor with tools that are diamond tipped and could eat skin off her fingers, but she loves that at the end of it she gets jewelry to keep or sell (and do not bargain with this child, she will make you regret it). And she does have to sell some of it, because she has to pay me back for the raw materials used in anything she keeps. Nothing is free. Figured I'd teach her that too. Plus maybe she'll have some financial sense.

So we bond a lot, we talk a lot, I don't shy away from hard subjects, and I tell her the truth about the world as best I can.

As for the shit tests at an early age? I nip that shit in the bud. If it even starts I can stop it by saying her first name (not the shortened cuter version) in a certain tone. She immediately knows that the behavior she is exhibiting is unacceptable, that I disapprove, and that if it continues or if I see it again there will be consequences. And I hold firm to that.

I'll let her do a lot of shit other parents won't though as long as she follows my rules and keeps meeting my high standards. She was watching the Lord of the Rings trilogy with me at age 6. She loves the scene where Frodo gets attacked by the spider. She watched it over and over again. She has read the Hunger Games trilogy and we have discussed how it is a critique of society. Her mother let her watch the Twilight movies, she thought they were dumb. I was so proud.

I've also been talking high level philosophy around her since an early age. My degree was in Religious Studies which was a sub-branch of Philosophy so I got a lot of logic and rhetoric.

Here is something that happened that first year of the divorce (yeah, the damn thing took nearly two years, another story for another day). The ex enrolled her in school in the district nearest the apartment she moved into, 35 miles from where we had lived together, which was only 5 miles from my work.

Ended up I had to cart my child 70 miles round trip, twice a day (yes, 140 miles a day 5 days a week, so 600 miles every other week) to get her to school on time and pick her up on time. I'm lucky my boss didn't fire me. He worked with me and I made the time up. But I digress.

With a good 45 minutes of a captive prisoner in the car I would just talk to her about whatever philosophical topic was on my mind. I'd pose old logic puzzles from antiquity. Anything to pass the time, we did not listen to music, we still don't in the car, we talk. Then we moved on to Plato, Aristotle, and by the end of her Kindergarten year we were talking about Freud's theory on religion and various creation myths from different religions.

I've always been told that young children have great facility to understand abstract concepts. I have seen nothing to contradict this. She understood and has retained a lot of those complex ideas. It scares me at times because she is smarter than I was at that age, what will she become?

The other big thing with my daughter, and this really may be key, is that I keep her on a schedule. School or no school it doesn't matter. She gets up at the same time every day regardless. During the summer she goes to work with me every day and is my extra set of hands when I need to turn a screw on a computer, or run a maintenance program. During the school year we have a regiment. We have the same morning routine every day. When I pick her up from school she comes to work with me and the first thing she does is all of her homework. Once that is done she is allowed to do what she wants as long as she tells me what it is. 

She is aware that there are consequences for lying as well, and that goes for any topic, no lies. Unacceptable. At the same time she knows that I will reward hard work, excellent school reports, and positive behavior. Not over the top rewards, but enough to keep her going in the right direction.

The reward for school grades can be tricky though for a smart kid that gets A+'s easy. So I've made the system work in both directions. She gets credit for an A, but anything below an A will cancel out that A's credit. One B costs one A. One C costs two As, One D cancels out all rewards and incurs punishment. I have repeatedly told her she doesn't want to know what happens if I see an F. She is aware that if she screws her grades up she can end up owing me money. She did the math.

So, discipline and routine, combined with motivation and a whole hell of a lot of hard work, making sure she respects me, and understands that her actions have consequences both good and bad.

Now that is a block of text. Guess I've had quite a bit to say on the topic.

cjbyrsk,"I really think this should be put on the sidebar in this sub. It answers the question that many fathers of daughters have immediately upon discovering the pill.

**""How do I keep my daughter from becoming a whore?""**

Well, there is a lot you can do, there is a lot you should do, not because it affects the outcome, but because you should enjoy being a father, and enjoy your children.

In the end though, her peer group will influence her more than anything else. If she hangs out with the burgeoning carousel riders then guess what she'll turn out to be, regardless of your effort?

So, my big takeaway from all of this has been: Vet her peer group, disapprove of the burgeoning attention whores and don't let her hang out with them.

How? That is up to the individual.

I involve my daughter in appropriate hobbies I enjoy that will improve her self worth. Working with power tools, learning how to make something with her hands, rock climbing, building a computer herself, learning how to handle money, etc. Typically masculine stuff.

You be the type of man you want to see her with. You can tailor your bonding time with your daughter in ways that teach her lessons of discipline, consequences, responsibility, courage, self-reliance, etc. while at the same time building up her sense of self-worth and confidence.

I want my daughter to shine above the cesspool that culture has made of modern women.

So I assume this is the culprit for the dumbing of people. Tell them they aren't born smart so they dont even try, that's actually a pretty intelligent plan on its own.

I'll just give you my example of how stupid the part 2 theory is... Fuck it, I'm not even going to dignify that shit by calling it a ""theory,"" to me, its just another form of religion.

Born in India, mom didn't even finish high school, wasn't even close. Dad finished college, worked an easy job at a high school as an accountant. In my eyes, a middle schooler with decent math skills could be an accountant, he would just have to learn some of the laws and a little bit of business theory... which they spend a mother fuck ton of time memorizing random pointless shit anyways, im sure adding a little bit of law and shit in there wouldn't be a problem at all.

Since starting school in India, didn't finish less than 5th place in my overall grade for all the school i did there. Finished 4th grade there then family decided to move to this shitty place. Now, a fucking 9 year old has the task of learning how the society works, what proper behavior is, what others expect of you, didn't know a shred of the language, most of the teachers and pupils were assholes, on and on.... Fuck man, this makes me think of how good i had it over there and didn't appreciate it at all. Such good people, always willing to help with anything, everyone knew each other... fuck man.

So, after this massive ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE, first few years were easy since it was just learning English and shit, (B/B- average), I managed to fail 8th grade, was C/C- average student from then on until HS finished only because they put me in ""standard"" classes (which is a step above the down syndrome classes), got less than 1200/2400 on SAT that I tried 3 fucking times on, couldn't manage to even get a 3.0 (i think it ended up at like 2.7) in a fucking community college that I spent 3 years in... oh ya, i didn't finish community college. I should also mention, I didn't do drugs of any sort (this includes alcohol, sadly i have to say this separately since apparently it isn't obvious alcohol is a drug), didn't hang out with bad kids, none of that. 

The biggest difference is, which should point out the ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS as the DIRECT CAUSE!!!!!:
Realize school in India is MUCH MORE rigorous, 6 day weeks, the teachers could beat you and whatnot, mandatory tuition, parents were on my dick about every little thing and they were upset I didn't get fucking first place every year, etc. etc... 

Still, with that said, I wouldnt blame my parents all that much, they were just as ignorant in moving here. None of us knew what was coming, I think they were just as scared once they got here. Still, the environment is the DEFINING FACTOR!

Side note: there are people who actually believe alcoholism is genetic, that makes me laugh just as much as ""Part 2: The Parental Effect."" When you blame genetics (in issues like this), you take away responsibility from the person.

I instinctivly raised my daughter like this from the start. I always believed in the concept of ""tough love"" paired with education.

I will of course sometimes use ""because I say so"" but just as a quick solution in a situation where the explaination would take too mich time. I will then, after the situation is solved, explain it in detail and answer questions, since it will mostly be things which might require some detailed explaination, like exceptions from common rules, or things which involve concepts which aren't too easy to understand at her current stage of developement. 

I am a very strong believer in the fact that children not only need guidance to avoid dangers and understand our social structures, but that it makes them more happy and satisfied since they have something to rely on in their decision making processes. I believe ot is the same with most adults too by the way. They crave leadership and guidance by a soft hand.

I've witnesses it at my main contractor where zhe employees where genuinly unhappy although it's a very good working place, because the management was too soft and there were no clear rules, everything was wishy-washy.

You obviously can't hit them or even touch them.  You can probably put them in the corner.  If the little shits don't listen, stick them in the corner where they can't have any fun.  Don't call it punishment, make up some frilly name so parents don't get their jimmys ruffled.  Like say you had to put little Timmy in the thinking spot so he could think about what he did. Think the rule of thumb is one minute for what ever age they are.  5 years old = 5 minute time out.

And lastly, one of the best tools when dealing with unruly little turds is redirection.  If they are doing something they are not supposed to, yelling or telling them to stop really wont have any effect.  But redirecting their attention to something else will.

You do have the ultimate discipline, exclusion.  If you have little Johnny or Jenny acting out.  Say to them clearly, ""If you can't follow direction, I will take you back to Mom and Dad.""  Then do it.

If the church you're doing this at won't let you do that then you don't have the tools you need.

Also, don't ask little boys if they want to do something.  They'll give you the answer they are thinking of.  I see this with teenage girls watching young boys.  They'll be like ""Can we all get together and line up?""  A little boy brain thinks ""I'm sure we can but I don't want to"".  Tell them specific instructions.  ""OK, get in line""

Girls on the other hand look for social cohesion, so use that to your advantage.  ""Ok ladies, who wants to help me line up?""",UEMcGill,11,t3_2hwxkj,2014-10-01 11:42:51

This is your reason for writing this in the first place.  So, the hard part of giving-choices is that you have to really work at finding two good choices.

cnc5n29,"So there's some confusion in this thread over the terms positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, positive punishment, and negative punishment. 

You can look this up on google and understand the reasoning for categorizing incentive schemes in this way, but for now I'll just say that negative reinforcement means you are trying to encourage your son's behavior (i.e. reinforcing) by removing (removing = negative) an undesirable feature from the child's environment. 

An example of negative reinforcement would be ""If you sit still in church today, you won't have to eat your vegetables tonight.""

The commenters above are talking about positive punishment, which would be ""If you don't sit still in church, you will have to do the dishes."" Positive = action must be performed. Punishment = to disincentivize the behavior.

And while negative reinforcement and negative punishment are not effective ways to train your dog, positive punishment is actually highllyyyy effective and commonly employed, with the caveat that for dogs and small children the effectiveness of the punishment is much higher if the punishment occurs immediately after the behavior you want to stop, i.e. rubbing a dog's nose in its pee if it pees in the house.

Just wanted to clear that up so that we have common language to discuss this with and don't end up talking past each other.",trpMilo,2,t1_cm8018g,2015-01-02 12:55:35
cnc5t6j,"Positive reinforcement is encouraging good behavior.  
Negative reinforcement is discouraging bad behavior.  

Giving a child a treat for good behavior is positive reinforcement.  
Putting a child in timeout for bad behavior is negative reinforcement.  

The dog training rules I learned give you a 2-second window to either encourage or discourage behavior.  So if you come home and your dog has pooped on the carpet, you have to just clean it up and move on with life.  Any punishment will be misunderstood by your dog.

&gtIn [behavioral psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism), __reinforcement__ is a [consequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning#Tools_and_procedures_of_operant_conditioning) that will strengthen an organism's future behavior whenever that behavior is preceded by a specific [antecedent stimulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antecedent_(behavioral_psychology\)). This strengthening effect may be measured as a higher frequency of behavior (e.g., pulling a lever more frequently), longer duration (e.g., pulling a lever for longer periods of time), greater magnitude (e.g., pulling a lever with greater force), or shorter latency (e.g., pulling a lever more quickly following the antecedent stimulus).

cncfz88,"Fair enough.  

When I was originally thinking of negative reinforcement, I was thinking of when I used a shock collar with my dog.  I had a trainer that required we do at least an hour of training with him on the use of the collar.  As he said, if you, as the trainer, don't maintain strict discipline with it, then your dog is just going to be confused and in pain.  But when used correctly, it gives your dog very clear signals as to incorrect behavior and it ties in to instinctual correction behavior.  

The particular model I had had very sensitive controls so you could set it to the minimum threshold for your dog.  I used it specifically with teaching the command, ""Come!"".  Starting with a short leash (6 feet), saying the word, then drawing the dog to me, and giving him a treat when he got to me.  Standard positive reinforcement, rewarding the correct behavior.  When he was solid on that, I moved to a 24' leash, continuing in the same vein.  Then I went to a shock collar and a 100-300' range.  With my dog some distance away, I would say ""Come!"", then apply the shock.  When he reached my feet, I would let off the button.  This is technically negative reinforcement, since I was stopping the noxious effect once he had completed the task.  

It's been 9 years since that training, and I haven't kept up with it as much as I should, what with life getting in the way and all, but he's still pretty good at coming when called.

Also, remember that kids may appear not to listen and even rebel, but when they mature, they will remember all those words of wisdom you bestowed upon them.  Also, NEVER use your experiences as an example.  The only reason I started smoking weed is because my parents not smoking weed lecture talked about how at the time it was great, but fucked with them long term.  Kids don't think long term.

I 100% agree with the necessity to be proactive.  90% of the shit that happens in the first 3 years is predictable.  Assuming your kid has no special needs, there isn't much variety.  They all tend to follow the same script.  

(OP's advice above is great... the rest of my post is more focused on babies/toddlers.)

A little preparation goes a long way.  Do your homework.  You don't have to become an expert, but you don't want to be standing there armed with nothing but a blank stare. At least know where to find the answers.

Google will find you thousands of websites.  Bookmark a couple that seem simple and practical.  You probably already know the nearest ER/hospital, but scout around for after-hours urgent care as well.  If you're in a metro area, Yelp and similar sites are great for checking out pediatricians and facilities.  

Less serious issues, just off the top of my head:

* cutting/cleaning umbilical cord
* circumcision (should be the father's decision)
* buying/installing car seat
* sleeping area (newborn may not go immediately to the crib)
* diaper rash (major and minor)
* cuts &amp scrapes
* diarrhea/vomiting
* ear aches (I still have nightmares)
* cough/cold/runny nose
* general insomnia
* ages for crawling/walking gates and barriers
* ages and methods for potty training
* ages and treatments for teething

You typically can't give medicine to babies/toddlers, so learn what alternative treatments are available.  Most have minimal effect, but you and mom will feel better trying *something* than sitting helpless while the baby suffers.

**SCAMS**

New parents are a prime target for scams.  You're putting baby first, money second.  Your wallet is wide open, and every doctor and salesman knows it.

* Hospital hearing test - Just say no.  You can get it done at your pediatrician's office for 1/10th the cost.

* Cord blood/stem cell storage - Huge waste of money for 99.99%.  Opt out unless you have genuine medical reason.

* Excessive ultrasounds - Unless your doc sees a problem, there's no fucking reason to be getting more than one scan a month.  Ask why they want you back so soon.  Unless they give you a concrete reason, put it off.

* Newborn clothes - Waste of money.  Unless your kid is premature, it'll grow out of newborn-sized clothing within a week or two.  Yes, get a nice, cute outfit for the ""coming home"" photos.  But buy cheap stuff for day-to-day wear.  They will get milk stains, peed on, shit on, etc.

* Miscellaneous crap - Bottle sanitizers, baby monitors, newborn furniture, dirty diaper bins, bathing platforms, etc.  Keep it simple. Don't overspend. Question the necessity (your grandparents didn't need any of this gimmicky shit).  Buy used if you can.  You'll only need these things for a few months.

In general, if someone is trying to scare or guilt you into spending money, start asking questions.  Don't let them pressure you.  Be polite but firm.  Pull out your phone and look it up for yourself.  Make your own decision.

This varies by state after birth, but the first thing you are going to want to do is to file a court order to establish a paternity claim on your boy. 

In the mean time get your situation in prime shape and suitable to house a child if you plan on contesting paternity.

BE WARNED: if you follow through with seeking paternal claim to your boy and win, in most cases you are liable to handle the burden of providing for him until hes 18 - meaning you are liable for financial child support if you are not granted custody.

custody is most commonly granted to mothers.

Get law council and determine all of the procedures required and establish a game plan. once you have plans in place, determine which is the most likely scenario and play it smart.

ct1kd7z," My daughter eats fruits (and oddly some choice veggies) for treats. If she's been really good I'll give 'em a light sugar coating. I *do* occasionally split a soda with her once every 3-4 months (sprite or ginger ale). I did let her choose between regular and chocolate milk and she goes for the regular kind - every time. She drinks water which (surprising as it may be to LordDumbass) is an important catalyst for many bodily functions - including brain functions. I also grow my own food which has numerous benefits. It's pesticide/hormone free. It allows me to cut my food bills down to just bread, milk, and meat (from the meat market which is local raised cattle, pigs, and wild caught game). It gives me ample time to think about things and process the various topics that I study. And it allows me to teach my daughter meaningful labor. Last - it gives me a sentimental buzz watching my daughter enjoy food that I literally made from seedling to a finished meal. Fuck yeah, dad win.

I do not buy her things *just because* she wants them - daddy doesn't need to buy her love. She knows that he loves her because he actively plays with her. A trick that I do to encourage myself to play, especially after a long day of work when I'm already tired, is to treat play time as work-out time too. It helps me stay in shape and lets us have fun at the same time. This is important for bonding, learning, and to help us both stay active (and not slovenly like SlumCaptain over here). To get back to buying ""pretty""/trendy things: she doesn't argue or complain - it is what it is to her. She sees that I don't buy myself stuff every time we're out the same applies to her. Do as I do not just because ""I say so"".

TV - this is a big one that some numbskulls don't get. There is no need to be plugged into the idiot box. I don't really watch movies or television. I did used to watch a lot of Family Guy and South Park growing up (I'm 24) but as I grew up and matured I realized how pedantic it is. It means nothing, it teaches nothing of value (not since most of real education shows started going off air - there *might* be some left over but not as many. I wouldn't know - I'm not missing all of that wasted time). I read/study, work on the gardens, practice shooting, spend time with my family,  and work on various projects and all of that helps me understand the world around me - instead of staring at a screen for 3-5 hours in my underwear. I explore my thoughts and contemplate morality, politics, society, spirituality and etc too. By being productive in such ways my daughter conducts herself accordingly. In the process she learns so much more than anyone does from binge-watching cartoon network. She's well on her way to being an intelligent, mature, and resourceful woman.

Many people are healthy eaters anyways and those ones you don't really have to worry about on that account. As far as trendy stuff - there will be kids who are incredibly self-absorbed and spoiled. They are going to insist that *their* brand is cool. That's just consumerism though. If you instill a healthy respect of priorities it won't be a problem and if your child, as a working teen, wants to buy whatever they want - we'll that's OK too.

I think some of my words set you off, which is why you haven't understood anything I wrote, but that's actually the very discussion I was trying to have. I'm interested in balancing a healthy lifestyle, while in an unhealthy world, and still raising happy, socially aware and normal children.

I'm not an extremist, I'm actually looking to raise pretty normal children. I am interested in others who have done so in a ""different"" way, because I believe that the ""normal"" way is becoming more and more destructive to even adults in our society, let alone children.

That's only seen as ""extreme"" by people who prefer not to think about what they're doing, and who ""deserve"" indulgences as part of their life, without effort. lol I'm not threatening your ice cream -- I just think that there are more fulfilling indulgences in life.

Think back to when you were a child... Do you remember the taste of a scoop of ice cream, or do you remember the experience of sharing it with friends and family? I'd bet it was the second one. You could have that same experience without the ice cream, and it would be just as fulfilling, and just as strong a memory. (btw my best childhood memories were spent playing outside, where we forgot about food for HOURS until we were starving)

&gt No tv? If you think tv is nothing but a brain drain you watch the wrong telivision. Wqtch Stephen Fry, or Niel Degrasse Tyson, or any intellectuals shows. Expand access to information if you want intelligent children and don't limit it.

I am however against ""mindless consumption"", which is sadly what happens when lazy parents sit their children down on the couch without any care or guidance.

&gt Last but not least you are for some ungodly reason a redpill subscriber.

this is actually a very common phenomenon among young adults who have been the victim of helicopter parenting. suddenly being released into adulthood often results in depression, anxiety, and reckless behavior such as spending too much or drinking.

Nice, I totally agree with all you said, especially about not using guilt, shame or violent limiting of experiences to control children.

I've been thinking of it recently like the ""frame"" of the household. Instead of angrily enforced rules, it's ""just the way it is"" in the house. There is no rubbish food or tv inside.

When it's framed like that, it's no longer a rule, it feels more like a tradition that you can be proud of. Especially when it's easy to get around by eating out. 

I've even tested this on adults who've stayed with me. Even though they have never controlled their own diet their entire lives, they feel good because they can just leave and eat out anytime they want. And during just one week they'll eat 80% healthier than normal and it won't feel like a chore/diet/being controlled.

I believe in controlling a toddler completely though. They're different because they can't decide for themselves yet. I don't want some ignorant mums rubbing hormone disrupting sunscreen on them or feeding them sugar filled rubbish and thinking they're being ""kind"".

I'm interested in hearing what someone thinks will happen by the time the kid becomes a teenager. I seriously don't think it'll be a problem, because as much as people think my post is about nazi-like-control, I actually exert very little control over others except what they bring into my house.

My kids will probably have less rules than most, only normal rules, complete freedom as they get older, and a tradition of good food and healthy entertainment at home.

I don't plan on controlling a teenager like most people think from my post. Especially not like I see many parents doing today -- with irrational, emotionally changing rules that do not justify the force with which they are enforced, usually using guilt/shaming tactics.

Anyway I just wanted to clarify that I'm not aiming for as authoritative a stance as most people think. 

What do you think about ""framing the household"" like that?

Instead my wife just did the whole thing just completely alone. I did not realize this is hard for her.

And that did not help our relationship. Basically I am in that strange and weird situation where my marriage problems are about not putting in enough beta. Seriously. You all know in a marriage you have to balance it, and I didn't, as I was just not interested in the whole baby-nappy-milk stuff. 18 months in and I did not change a nappy yet. 

But anyway this led to her breaking down crying a couple of times, crying that she cannot handle this alone, she expected her to have an actual husband and the child a father. Not just a guest in the house who comes home, drinks beer, eats dinner and reads books.

So now I am sometimes doing things like feeding our daughter or giving her a bath. 

And in this kind of situation this ""more beta"" makes my wife really different in a good way, opens up, is not so depressed, laughs, radiates sexuality, looks 10 years younger. It is just reassuring to her to get some help from me.

cvhfzin,"Thanks for sharing your perspective on it!

&gt But my mother also quotes her mother, saying ""You had principles, and then you have children."" Means that principles like no TV tend to melt when your toddler is screaming all day and all you want is a rest.

I can see how anyone, even me, would let their principles melt to get a child to stop screaming :)

In this situation, what a parent does is probably a reflection of their own habits when they feel tired themselves, do you think?

In your case, it sounds like you don't watch tv often, so when you occasionally need a break from your child you sometimes put them in front of the tv?

For example, in another family, if a parent watches lots of tv and eat snacks to relax daily, they are more likely to feed their kid cheap snacks in front of the tv even when they're not crying, just like they do themselves.

In my case, if I have a bad day I lose my willpower and will eat whatever food is easiest. For that reason I only allow healthy food in the house, so now I eat well no matter how I feel. On these lazy days, I will usually force myself to exercise or play to increase my energy, and then relax later with a movie or listening to music.

So I guess I might fall back to that when my child is crying a lot? Maybe play with them, exercise with them to get blood pumping, and then put them in front of a movie or leave them with music playing and toys to play with. That sounds good for a lazy day! Otherwise I personally watch movies after I've worked hard for the week, or as a group activity with friends/family, and never browse channels on the tv because the antenna isn't even plugged in.

&gt I don't think the kindergarten feeds my child shit. I saw the menu list. Pretty reasonable. Probably designed by a nutritionist. Meat and vegs more or less.

Of all the things you said, I think this is the only valid point you made, and what I'm most concerned about and interested in discussing.

But first let me address your other concerns though, so you know where I'm coming from. I definitely agree with you about helicopter parenting, and here's the idea I've kind of fleshed out since reading replies to this thread:

I agree with giving the child as much freedom to learn and explore as possible. Regardless of how my thread comes across to most people, I'm not nazi like. Obviously when a child is young their freedom is limited, but as their age and mental capacities increase so does their responsibility, personal responsibility and freedom.

Most of my ""rules"" are actually not rules at all, they are the lifestyle that I live. The only rule is ""No unhealthy food in the house"". Everything else is just how I do it. The tv antenna is not even plugged in, I only use the TV for movies.

I would never feed a toddler processed food, but as the kid ages, and learns about food, and gains responsibility, they are welcome to experiment however they want.

&gt but pointless restriction of a little person with feelings and desires like any other person seems cruel.

This changes with age, but a child's ""wants"" (feelings and desires) often directly conflict their ""needs"" (health, protection, love etc). This is where a parent has 100% responsibility. If they feed a child toxic food, or sugary food even once that will negatively affect the delicate balance of the child's health and microbiome, then they are violating that responsibility, regardless of whether they frame is as ""allowing responsibility"", ""just a little snack"" or some other responsibility-mitigating rationalisation.

&gt the fact that you force your lifestyle onto your girlfriend definitely tells me that you would force it on to an impressionable young child.

It's obviously her choice or she would've left :) Everyone knows how perverted todays food has become, but it's still VERY difficult to change. People pay MONEY to have someone enforce their diet and exercise on them. Anyone who has tried to diet due to health reasons will tell you how they HATE their ""feelings and desires"", and they are in direct opposition to what they actually want in life. If we were animals we would follow them blindly, but part of being human is our prefrontal cortex and the control it gives us over our base instincts (which are chemical reactions btw, and directly affected by what we eat due to that)

Now on to your concern about affecting the kid's social development and interactions later in life. If you have any thoughts please let me know, because I'm still fleshing it out, but here's what I'm thinking:

The ""rules"" in my house already feel like a tradition, and thats how I'm hoping it will be later too. I mentioned in another comment here, but I've had adults stay with me and while they are free to eat out, they usually don't and end up eating healthier than they've ever eaten in their lives without feeling it was forced on them. It really works well, because most people, including me, are lazy and just eats what's easiest.

As the kid gets older, I'm hoping they experiment, try things, get hurt, make mistakes, but always have this strong tradition of mindful health and healthy entertainment at home to fall back on no matter what. They'll have strong, well nourished bodies to handle the stressors of everyday life, as well as a mindful understanding of everything that affects their body, what they're doing, and the differences with what everyone else is doing.

I might push slightly for more social interaction than usual to make sure they develop well at it, all while balancing it with compassionate teaching and communication at home (I'm busy reading non-violent communication, it sounds amazing for this). By ""pushing"" I mean being mindful of being social myself, allowing the children to observe me socially, and allowing them to be social themselves.

Actually, that is sounding like typical parenting now :) 

But what will make the difference is the foundation of health it is built on. Health shouldn't be forced, or a rule, but unfortunately in todays world it has to be, for the parents at least, to change their years of conditioning to a perverted way of life. But for someone raised differently, in both worlds, I'm hoping it's different.",homeliss,1,t1_cu3775e,2015-09-28 20:52:13
cvqlqvs,"I've only been in the similar situation for less than a year with my two boys, 3 and 6 yos.  The mother has been gone since January and has erratically bothered to physically see them a total of 4 times (which they devolved into monsters the first 3 times after I got them back).  

Most she ever does is call them on the phone.  Which worked for a time.  Then they grew bored of that.  So she started to doing facetime, again, worked for a time now they are bored with it.

Even after heavy amounts of damage control on her behalf towards the boys, it never did any real good.  It only ever band-aided the loss, come to find out.  I was talking with a friend one day, and she (which is very RP herself) made the statement that ""...maybe they feel like they should miss her..."" and ""...that maybe the damage control is only prolonging the feeling.""  

That was the breakthrough I needed.  My boys, even with all the damage control, had already made their mind up about their absent mother.  I was the one that needed to stop fighting on her behalf when she won't do it herself.

It's been 2 months now since I've quit damage control.  If, during the rare time, they would say ""I miss my mom"" or anything like that I either say ""ok"" or don't acknowledge it.  Sounds harsh, but the results are unbelievable.  Hardly any behavioral problems out of the 6yo anymore e.g. he was hitting, spitting on people, throwing furniture.  The works.  Now, he's paying attention in school, being very considerate and nice to others.

I'm still working on the 3yo, however, but its understandable since he's only 3.  Although, he has came a long way too, I find it hard to play the additional roll of ""mommy"" just because I won't coddle my kids.  Sure I'm caring and warm towards them, but I don't put up with certain behavior.

Unfortunately, finding a good therapist can take longer than resolving the underlying issues.  Good luck.",RedPope,2,t3_3nr4fj,2015-10-06 23:04:19
cvr8mfg,"2 girls myself and the most important thing I think you can do is to be the man you want her to be with.  Not in that creepy down south way, but be the example of who she should bring home.  Mine are 2 and 6 and I take them on dates.  Tell them where we are going because of a certain food we should try or the atmosphere.  Open the door for them.  Pick where to sit and get them settled.  Take charge and make it fun.  be in control. Start conversations, but also talk about what you would like to talk about.  

Remember, once they hit puberty and all that ""AWALT"" shit kicks in, you really can't control their horrible decisions.  All you can do is try to be a good influence and hope for the best.  Try to teach them to be independent and never rely on men or even need men.  Try to get them to understand that finances aren't everlasting and to actually save a dime once in a while. (If I meet a woman with good fiscal sense, I really don't know what I would do). Basically teach them to not be cunts and act more like men.  That is what I am going for.  Try to make science interesting ( we watch How It's Made a lot). Try to get them to make decisions on their own and be assertive.  Try to encourage critical thinking and logic.

RED PILL Take: Dont be afraid to let your child make mistakes but be the rock for them when they fail. Help them, teach them how to correct it, but let them do it.

cw5mkvt,"&gt hawkishly ""helping"" them face any adversity the child experiences

I agree with what you wrote but I want split a small hair here about ""help"". There is a nuance that is important.

Helping them progress pass challenges is good if you do it correctly (it instills a sense of mastery). Helping them by shielding them from challenges is not good (denies opportunity for mastery). Helping them by removing consequences is not good (instills a false/incomplete/contingent mastery).

When they've climbed too far into a tree and are starting to panic about climbing down, help them with the panic but defer any physical assistance as long as possible (or longer). Give them a pep-talk/advice/help them focus on how to solve the problem and get themselves out. Physically intervene only when absolutely necessary to avoid serious bodily harm (i.e. cracked skulls). They climbed into the damn tree in the first place, they sure as hell can go back the way they came.

I have three little ones (oldest is six) and quite often I see parents at the playground who just cannot allow their kids to even attempt ""dangerous"" things or can't stand to let the little kids stew in challenge. Kids need to experience the thrill of pushing boundaries and learn to process terror and handle their shit. And if my kids are anything like me there's nothing better than the thrill after you've just saved your own ass. What I'm saying is that if your kid climbs too far into a tree and starts to panic--by all means they need close attention. Help them get control of the situation mentally. Give them a pep talk. Help them formulate a plan. They don't know how to think through stressful situations. But for the love of god don't immediately reach up and pull them out of the tree because you can't stand to see them whimpering or crying. One type of helicopter parent didn't allow them to climb. The other type of helicopter parent allowed them to climb and immediately saved them. Don't do that. It cheats them.",ViciousFrilledLizard,6,t1_cw5i6vp,2015-10-19 19:31:57

cw699rf,"The way to not do this is to have a clear vision of how you want your children to be. If you think they should grow to be independent and resourceful, then, the only way to teach them that is to give them enough freedom to make mistakes, and own up to them. So you can't be all over them all the time, you need to give them space for them to learn that stuff. This also means they will get hurt more, they will be in more dangerous situations, and they will make more mistakes, often ruining stuff. They should face consequences for those, but the consequences shouldn't to punish them for having initiative, but for teaching them responsibility.

This requires a lot of patience. You have to let things happen on their own, and this oftens means more work for you in the end when they don't go well. You then turn this into a learning moment (with consequences), but don't get so frustrated you then decide to control everything your children do.",strategos_autokrator,2,t3_3pdy93,2015-10-20 09:31:16

cw6dxrz,"An addition to this...it starts when they are infants. Don't run to them every time they cry! Learn the meanings of their different cries. They are intelligent, communicating beings just with a limited vocabulary.

Just because they fell on their bum and let out a wail doesn't mean you need to come running to comfort them. Same when they are older, every minor scratch and boobo doesn't need to elicite a big response. 

This trains them not to manipulate you and to not make a big deal out of minor hurts and you not to dote on them and be manipulated.

You will soon enough learn when they give a cry that actually hurts.

You'll notice sometimes they'll fall/bang them selves, look at you to see if they should cry or not. I'm talking babies learning to crawl/walk here. You're response trains them on how they should react. If you make a big deal about it, so will they, every single time.

That gets annoying fast.

An element of frame comes into play here. Sometimes they fall on their butt and pretend to get hurt. You can tell when they're putting up a front. 

Then you give them that look and they quickly quiet down and go about their day. Sometimes they'll persist and you persist to mock or make fun of them and they'll visibly have a hard time keeping the act up and not smiling. Its hilarious.

cwk7ibf,"Thanks for that great recommendation, I'm actually already a few videos through that same playlist, I found it 3 weeks ago!

In those 3 weeks Stefan Molyneux has become my most favorite person in the world.

I know the title of my post ""sounds"" violent, but that's never been my intention. 

Peaceful parenting is based partly on knowing the disastrous effects violence has on a child's future, but we have the same data about the effects of poor dietary choices on a child's future too.

We know exposure to environmental toxins, nutrient deficiencies, high carbohydrate consumption etc. all have bad, well studied effects on health, especially growing kids. 

Lot's of the studies Molyneux quotes about children (such as twins studies) even adjust for nutrient deficiencies while studying effects on their iq and behavior. Nutrient deficiencies are only one thing we can adjust for, what about things like living in moldy rooms, having unbalanced gut bacteria, etc?

And the same as you wouldn't allow another parent to be violent to your kids, I wouldn't want another parent to ignorantly feed my child shit. 

(although since finding Molyneux my view has changed slightly: I won't send a child to daycare anymore, so I'm not too worried about things happening in the control(care?) of a someone else before then. Although I hope they will have plenty of interaction before then, just not be in the control of an ignorant low-wage caregiver.)

I want to do this with as much communication, teaching, learning and freedom as possible too. I think peaceful parenting differs from ""free parenting"" (i don't know what it's called, where parents allow the kids to do anything) only by having lots of communication and teaching, as well as boundaries, rules, limits etc. I'm hoping to do the same, and encourage free thinking, arguing etc.

Thanks again for sharing, that playlist is one of the most mind opening and life changing things I've come across.

cwkrpdf,"I have thought about these a while and they might change, but this is what I have so far for one son. (I expect to change what I do a bit for each of them. They're all different in talents/personalities/needs somewhat.)

When he turns 12, just he and I will go primitive camping for a weekend. We'll hike and set up camp and cook, etc. I want him to be just as much of a planner and worker as I normally am when I take the family camping. I plan on presenting him with a nice, good quality pocket knife.

At 13, we're building a motorized bicycle together (basically a homemade moped, from a kit). It'll be his when we're done. Hopefully he learns something about repairing and maintaining machinery. (He's fairly responsible even now, and I'm thinking by that age he'll be fine owning a moped.)

At 14 my plan is to help him start a small business whether it's cutting lawns in the summer or making websites for people. (I'll have to see where his interests/talents lie by that time.) The milestone gift is a quality, real wallet.

At 15 he should be able to dance. So, it's dancing lessons for him (swing, ballroom, or something else legit) and one of the weekend etiquette workshops that teach boys/girls social skills, proper manners, etc. The gift will be a trip to a men's store where I plan on getting him a proper suit, tie, belt, and shoes.

Haven't planned out the rest of the years yet. And these plans might change. But another milestone will be for him to take our state hunter safety course (and us go on a hunting trip), and another gift I plan on giving him when he's older (probably when he turns 18) is a really nice watch.

Basically, I want to gently ""push"" him a little more each year in some aspect of his character and abilities. And along with each small new experience I want to give him something to help cement it that he can treasure.

I love these guys and I want to let them know they can do almost anything they set their mind to, and they need to know that to meet that potential, they need to be equipped. So my milestones (and the whole process of a planned ""rite of passage"") are intended to help them along the path to adulthood.

A lot of this stuff I had to learn on my own, and it was after I left home (so, in my 20s). No one formally had ""the talk"" with me, no one taught me how to properly have a conversation in a social gathering, no one taught me how to handle finances, etc. I either was fortunate enough to happen upon mentors, or I actively sought out books and classes on things in which I knew I lacked ability.

Glad you've already discovered Molyneux! His videos, which I initially discovered through the libertarian/ancap stuff, were what inspired me to change my mind on having children, once I find the right woman (""unicorn"" as some around here would say).

I get the idea that he'll agree in general, so I'll need to get really specific in order to have an insightful discussion. After that, it'll be awesome just to hear him talk about it!

I know he's writing a book on it, and I just found this quote from him on it:

&gtIf you want your child not to yell when he is upset, you must have modeled for years beforehand not yelling when you are upset. If you want your child not to hit, you must have never hit your child. If you want your child to defer gratification, you must have modeled the deferral of gratification consistently for years beforehand. Attempting to enforce a rule you have not modeled is like trying to put the wings on a plane as it is leaving the ground – too little, too late the only result will be a fiery crash.

Your daughter will have the same biological urges her mom did at that age. You can't stop it, any more than her parents could.

Since I figure your son will soon be going to high school, make sure he joins something that will alow him to not just meet people, but really make bonds and relationships. Any sports team or even the band (it's what I did and I loved it) should do the trick. My high school also had a drama department that was basically inseparable, and as soon as they got to know each other they would go everywhere and do everything together. The whole team aspect and possible leadership roles that come from it will build confidence and just allow your son to believe in himself and be ready to conquer the damn world.

And after introducing the main points so that she understands them you can lead her to further improve herself on the Internet. But it is important to do the first steps yourself so that she will not misinterpret what she reads. It is also important to not leave her alone but regularly talk about what new stuff she learned.

cy5sayf,"We are doing very extreme parenting compared to what is though to be normal. We are paleo and following the continuum concept from Jean Liedloff:

* We sleep together with her.
* We carry her in a sling. We have no baby pram.
* We never let her be alone.
* She was only breast fed for half a year then she started to eat exactly what we eat. No baby food. We give her the bones to chew them.
* Also breast fed at night.
* She is still breast fed and will be at least until she is 2 yrs old. Maybe later.
* Paleo food only (mostly home made). Drink water only. Properly spiced food.
* All moving image is prohibited (TV, films, youtube and such). I think it will be a rule until she will be 6 or even later.

It seems draconian but we have lived on paleo already and we dont own a TV. So it is a natural extension of our lifestyle. I think that you can only enforce a rule if you follow similar life style yourself. 

She is 16 months old now. So it is pretty soon to make conclusions. Results:

* Totally calm. Always smiles. Everyone finds her extra cute.
* Does not cry a lot.
* No sleep problems. She sleeps pretty late (sometimes midnight) but sleeps until 10-11-12 with us. (She has learned our habits. It may not be healthy but we live that way.)
* We can take her to our programs when we meet with friends. She does not cause much problem.
* She did not need any medication until now. She only had minor colds and some fever when her tooth were coming.
* She loves pure chocolate (100% cacao without sweeteners) :-)
* She is very brave with unknown people. Approaches anyone she likes on public events.

There is a parenting club here where children are raised similarly. There are some 6-7-8 year old children of this kind. They behave really good. So I believe in this parenting strongly.

If you are interested in extreme parenting you should also read Elimination Communication. We did not know about it enough to start with it early enough. But we are planning to do it with the next children.

cy5ss5w,"""It can be difficult enough keeping an amused, calm and understanding frame when throwing away junk that my girlfriend smuggled into the house :)""

One thought about this: If you want to parent children in a decent way then first you have to set up the rules in your home _before_ the child comes. It is about keeping your frame. You have to vision the way you live with the child and practice it before you decide to make a child. For example it is very beneficial to have hobbies that you can pursue with the child too. Instead of TV meet people. Don't drink too much. Eat healthy. Don't buy unnecessary shit. If you have established that you are ready for the child.

If you help him to control his feelings - by cuddling a little when he cries - he will slowly learn how to do it himself. If you don't help him to control the feelings he may not learn it easily. Maybe crying will become a habit.

Mankind is evolved (God has made us) so that crying babies have the most annoying voice on Earth. It would not be logical to ignore that. If we were to ignore that then it would not be such an annoying sound.

cy696hz,"You are nieve. Children are quite good at manipulating adults with crying and tantrums to get what they want.

I'm not saying you don't respond to their cries. I'm saying you look critically at them, learn to understand what they mean and when they matter, and don't be manipulated by them.

When you jump, every time they cry, warranted or not, you reward that behavior and become the servant rather than the adult.

For example. The kid is learning to walk and falls on his butt. Not hurt at all. But the first reaction is to cry. If you make a big deal about it and confort them they then cry every time and make a big deal about it because it is rewarded with attention. If instead you make no big deal about it or make it out to be a humorous thing they quickly get over it and learn not to be dramatic and manipulative all the time.

In other words, they learn how to be mature and level headed i.e. adults. In the learning stage sometimes they'll fall then look at you to see your reaction and if they should cry or not. Your approach doesn't help them deal with it, it rewards NOT dealing with it.

You see this go wrong with children who run crying and wining to mom like their arm was ripped off for every insignificant bump. Hello helicopter parent.

The other classic is getting kids to go to sleep as a baby. When there is nothing wrong except they want to be held or in bed with you, you just have to let them cry it out. They quickly learn to get over it and are better off for it. The parents who run to the bedroom every time they cry and coddle and hold them, those are the ones who get little sleep at night, can't get the cockblock out of their bed, arn't in control of their own household.

This used to be common knowledge passed down generation to generation. But that broke down with the pussification of men as well as smaller families wherein kids didn't see their little siblings or cousins being raised from infancy.

I get inspired whenever I find people doing what I think is such important stuff, and I'm beaming to hear about what you're doing with your daughter.

Could you tell me more about the parenting club? Is it in the city or countryside, and how did you find it?

Also, what are you planning to do about school later on, and are you teaching her anything now? I'd be really interested to hear.

The Continuum Concept looks amazing, thanks again. I've been picking up pieces here and there, such as attachment disorders developing from separation and not enough physical contact, but this is the first time I've seen them put together.

My lifestyle has been changing so rapidly (always improving) in the last few years, but since those changes my household frame has been as unshakeable as it gets for about 3 years :)

I was initially worried about it being too strict/different/inflexible for a kid, but I've come to the conclusion that it will be awesome instead: think about it, if you put an excellent dad into any situation, he's STILL going to be an excellent dad and raise great children! The biggest influence is going to be from the parents, not the house rules or different lifestyle. Those will be a foundation on which the parenting could happen.

&gt If you have established that you are ready for the child.

The things you mentioned are established, but I don't feel ready. But that's probably because I'm not settled down in one location yet or as mentally prepared.

Also, I forgot to ask in my first reply, but what is your working situation and how much time do you and your wife spend with your daughter?

Thanks again! You've not only inspired me because of your lifestyle is so similar to mine and how I want to raise a kid in the future, but you also shared so much detail about your life and child. You're awesome.",homeliss,1,t1_cy5ss5w,2015-12-21 07:09:26
cy6ivru,"Thanks. I was a bit nervous about sharing such details as I find this thing unusual here on TRP.

I am very lucky with my profession. I have a business that makes me enough money so that my wife can be a stay-at-home mother. I work less than the ""normal"" 40 hours so I can also spend enough time with my daughter. I am pretty good in informatics so I think even in case my business goes down I could maintain this lifestyle at an ordinary job.

My wife has been working until she got pregnant but I hope she will not work any more (at a big company for money). I believe in old style gender roles :-). They do the groceries (carrying the daughter), cook and visit the mother+children clubs that are avialable here. She is studying to be an advisor on parenting issues (there are advisor networks of carrying, breast feeding and such). I hope she will pursue this as a carreer. It is perfect for a mother because she can do it with the child being with her but still she is doing something important so she will not feel useless and alone at home.

Some people may think that a stay-at-home wife is an inherent risk. I think that the proper paleo household and this bonding style of parenting is enough job for a mother. I also want to have several children. We only have one for now but our plan is to have at least three but ideally even more. It is almost impossible to properly parent several children besides a daytime job.",alwaysDisputing,1,t1_cy6fiir,2015-12-21 10:51:39
cy6js22,"We (Hungarians) have a paleo diet prophet who is a psychlogist by his profession. He is called Szendi Gábor. He has written several books about evolutionary psychology besides the paleo diet. His books was the first place where I read about red pill truths like hipergamy and other dark mating strategies of women. I think he is a genius I really owe him much. He is translating articles to Hungarian every month he finds interesting and I have read about the concept of evolutionary parenting there. The Continuum Concept was the first book I have read. It is a little too idealistic about the lifestyle of the Yequana. The book may also seem a little cheesy for a decent masculine man. But the concepts she shows are not against masculinity at all. Actually it is pretty red pill. She tells bold claims about the Yequanas having no problems with parenting. And it is almost totally how it works for us! It is amazing.

We are living in a big city and the club is by chance in 500m radius of our home. My wife has found it by networking with the local mothers. The local council owns a community center that homes the club. I can't tell more without breaking my incognito but in the improbable case you live in Hungary I can show you the exact place in private :-).

As far as I remember I have always been different than ordinary children and it never caused me any problem. I remember that Twin Peaks was new in Hungary when I was a kid (as a former communist counrty the trash culture of the USA has arrived to us a little late). Everyone was watching it in my class but I was not allowed to do that. Did I feel bad about it? Yes. How long did the bad feeling last? About 5 minutes. It is not a big issue. I also did not see any of the Disney movies. I could not tell the difference between Cinderella and 101 dalmatians. It did not cause me integration problem with the children.

Some paleo people fear what will happen when the kid eats a pizza (gluten) with her peers later when I am not there. Either she will have 0 problems. Then she will mis-eat from time to time. Not a big deal. Or she will vomit and have indigestion problems. Then she learns for a life not to ""cheat"" with diet. I don't see the issue here.

Children who are mistreated by the others are not the ones who are different but the ones who are weak. There was no instance in my life when I was mistreated by my peers for being different. And I don't fear that my children will have any.",alwaysDisputing,1,t1_cy6f37h,2015-12-21 11:35:28

Children learn most by their own interest and not on the schedule of the school.

cy6kcog,"It is a very complex topic about children psychology. I think you are not aware of the current scientific results about evolution based parenting.

Children who are ""let cry it out"" feel themselves as the baby who is left in the jungle alone under a bush. She will cry for her parents until she finds that it is useless and stops crying. When she stops crying it is not because she is calmed. It is because being silent is the survival strategy of an alone child under a bush in the jungle. She hopes that her parents find her sooner than the carnivores. In this state her stress level is so high that it severly undermines development of the nervous system and the immune system. It is also how inherent fears develop in people.

Cuddling and holding does not mean pussification. Because it is not the job of the man. It is the job of the woman. That's what she was born to do by nature. Man can and should also do that but not all day long because he has his own principle.

Crying is just communication without words. The child isn't struggling alone in the bush, he knows where you are. Sometimes he's trying to tell you somethings wrong, and sometimes he's in the other room trying to manipulate his parents and he knows it. If you're observant, you can tell the different cries and what they mean (easier with boys than girls).

Just cause they're crying doesn't mean you need to jump. This is just WISNIFG applied to children. Be the parent who can say no to his kid, not the one driven to and fro by their emotions and demands.

I'm dealing with on the ground, working successful wisdom that has passed from family to family generation to generation. 

You want to know where modern psychology got us with child rearing? Go out to a grocery store or other public place and observe the little terrorists we call children. Its totally out of control and in no small measure contributed to the upheaval we're seeing in the sexual marketplace.

cyhnzc7,"Great question, I have had my kids in Waldorf, Public and now Montessori, depending on what was available where we lived.  

For the younger ones (prek-2nd grade) I highly recommend a Waldorf or Montessori, they methodology behind those schools is incredibly suited for the young mind.  Less emphasis is placed on traditional academics, such as the three R's and more is placed on developing some of the basic foundations of learning and a joyful lifestyle- learning patterns, songs, art, cultivating curiosity, joyful participation in daily chores (preparing meals, snacks, cleaning up, etc.)  The pace of the day is also an important thing.  Our son absolutely loved going to school, he would return full of calm energy and was heartily engaged in chores and things at home, it was never a task to get him to participate. 

I think this is really important for the young ones, public pre k programs are so often like a factory, the workers are over extended, the curriculum involves rote, basic activities that I don't feel contribute to anything but the distraction of the child.  

Additionally, the teachers in Montessori and Waldorf are specifically trained in that modality which shows that they are committed to something other than an easy job.  I have found the teachers at those schools to be incredibly gifted with children and provide such a fantastic environment for them to be in- the pacing of the day, the individual attention and the group cohesiveness are unparalleled, IMO.  

Also, the parents at those schools tend to be a little more conscientious about the raising of their kids, which means that the kids, while not always, will come from homes with similar values as you are trying to instill.  SO much of our identity comes from who we spend time with.  

That being said, I think it depends on the school- our oldest is 10 now and in Montessori, and while it has greatly served him up until this point, I am not sure the academics are at his level anymore, I feel he needs to be much more challenged than he is.  It may depend on the school, however.   He is very STEM oriented, so we may switch him to a STEM type school or another school that has a greater focus on academics that will prepare his mind for other things.  

A problem a lot of people have with Mont. and Waldorf is that they don't stress reading skills till like second grade sometimes, some parents don't like that.  However, I think it has merit.  Reading, barring any significant developmental delay, comes naturally for most kids.  The single greatest thing you can do to promote literacy in your children is to read to them as often as you can.  Its great bonding, helps form their language skills and sparks their curiosity in books.   Our son was right on point with reading, not behind, but certainly not ahead.  Many parents feel like the earlier their kids read and reach milestones means they are more intelligent.  I don't think so, not always.  With the younger children you are building a foundation where they can feel safe and secure, not stressed by social pressures, etc., I think this helps them to learn how to learn.  If that makes sense.  

TLDR- I think Montessori and Waldorf type schools are the best bet for younger children. Once they get to like 3rd grade, I wonder about the academic rigor.

Now you can establish and show him what a healthy male social life looks like. Go out. Have fun. Be responsible and set a good example of a man. Have friends over to your house in groups. Include your son. Take him with your friends to a ball game. Camping trips, dinner, birthday parties, etc. All he's seen so far is the horrible fights and conflict. Let him see what it's supposed to look like so he can emulate it. 

Following this, if you meet a woman you want to or are already plating/dating/fucking/LTR he will know her already from your new social life. He'll have seen you both interact at a BBQ at your house, he'll have talked to her a few times that she strategically ran into him in these social situations and expressed an interest in his life. He'll know that she makes you happy and will like her as part of your social circle and will accept this much more than, ""hey son, I need to fuck other women, cool?"" He'll see how men and women should interact and how that relationship should look. 

Some might think it's BP not to overtly explain to him what you're doing and why—but that crazy harpy is his mother and he hasn't seen the example of a good relationship.

Ask him how you can help, have him set savings goals (save up x money by may, then by June save up Y and by August you can afford to fly out there and be on your own, etc). Give him some books to read on it and help him follow his heart.",tuxedoburrito,5,t3_42y67l,2016-01-27 15:34:34

If he had never worked a day in his life and wasn't responsible enough to take care of himself, I would be much more hesitant about supporting his decision, and would probably advise him against it.",_Mythos,3,t3_42y67l,2016-01-27 16:13:38

cze6kxy,"There's so many variables here but I've gone through the following schools with my now-fourteen-year-old boy in a medium size northeastern rust belt city:

private, catholic montessori preschool age 4-6: this was overall a good experience. With nothing to contrast it with, it's hard to say much about this except that it didn't seem to damage him. Part of me wants to assume some link between a high philosophy educational system and the feminine imperative but I don't think it's fair to say that my experience provided any evidence of this when I think back to it. Religion is another matter but this program was largely secular. In retrospect I think I'd steer clear of anything religious, regardless of whether the program was secularized.

private, secular elementary grade 1-4: absolutely outstanding in every way. None of the crap that you see in public schools with the testing and whatever else (by the way I work in a public charter high school so I know whereof I speak). If I had the money I would absolutely have kept him there but the cost was oppressive.

public, urban magnet IB middle/high school grades 5-6: the one last gem in the crown of a failed urban district. Supremely high-performing magnet school pushing all their kids into AP/IB diplomas. I took him out after two years. It was like they were indoctrinating him for a life of corporate accounting. Absolutely mind-numbing levels of homework. Three hours a night in 5th fucking grade. The kid was getting migraines. He's bright and creative, not particularly gifted in management/organization and that just killed him here. So glad it ended. For all its accolades, being in a failing district meant they really had nothing going for them but academics and this turned out to be just what he should have been focused on instead...

public, suburban high school grades 7-9(present): there's no doubt in my mind that this school is as much of an indoctrination center as any public school in America. Nonetheless, it works for him. He is fully aware of what he's immersed in due to enormous levels of script-busting by me over the years. That said, being in a district with money has its perks. Extra-curriculars are fantastic. Arts are fantastic. He can do the classic studies in things like engineering, woodworking, auto shop, that would be impossible in the magnet school because all they care about there is AP friggin English. We have kept him out of all AP tracks except science so he can take AP Physics in 12th grade. Other than that we consider the AP track an impediment to the engineering and vocational type training that he is truly interested in. Which is not to say that we are low balling him for some low wage future. He is on track to get into MIT and already takes their courses on edX.

Understand that this is a boy, that the world has changed a good bit in 15 years, and that all this varies a great deal from one place or school to another. He's also extremely cool and easy to parent. Your mileage may vary. Good luck.

EDIT: I just realized I might as well chime in with some of my other parenting philosophies that I think have paid huge dividends:

get rid of your tv. there hasn't been one in my house in over ten years and it is transformative

no daycare. no babysitters. the only one qualified to parent your child is you. it's bad enough you have to give him over to schools at age 5. if you have the means to home school you might wanna think about it. the early years are crucial.

no sugar. no junk food. no fast food. how are you going to grow a good brain/body on that crap?

DON'T EVER LIE TO YOUR CHILD, ESPECIALLY A SON. I mean no fucking santa claus or any of that shit. No lies of convenience. Women love this shit and you have to keep it away from your kid. My son has not turned on me in the typical teenage way and I swear it's because he knows I don't lie to him. Furthermore I try to prepare him for truths he doesn't know he needs to know yet. Like TRP, to the extent that it's at all appropriate for a kid his age. I refuse to let him have his mind destroyed. He is empowered in a great many ways. Tell him about your failures. Let him learn from your life.

another edit: your child's greatest teacher is you. don't shy away from that.",DannyMight,2,t3_3yo7pp,2016-01-27 17:24:19
cze7xar,"Thanks a lot for the thorough report. I really appreciated reading this, even though I live in Brazil and things are very different here. It's good to know that a catholic montessori school might be a good choice for the early years. I'll look into something like that.

I agree with most of your philosophy. I wouldn't want to lie to my kid, even though I believe that stimulating their imagination with fairytales could be a positive thing, if done in a playful way. Maybe there's a playful way to ""fake-believe"" in Santa Claus. I don't want him/her to be the odd little one who doesn't believe in Santa, but I don't want him/her mistrusting me either.

Public schools around here are awful. I went to one. It was violent as shit, my parents took me out of it when a 5-year-old boy was raped by a 13-year-old. 

I used to be a very skeptical redpiller, a typical atheist, but like many people who were into PUA and Redpill, at some point I went the christian way. This is a pattern that is starting to emerge. Eventually, after getting a grip on ourselves and getting tired of sleeping with random women, we all realize that family is important, and with that invariably also comes religion, which is really the only way that strong values can stand ground.

That said, I believe that teaching christian values and philosophy is also a must. I'm not sure yet how I'll do that, but it's already decided. Maybe you don't agree with that, and I'm curious as to what you think about it.",zopiro,3,t1_cze6kxy,2016-01-27 17:53:56

czfjuyl,"I've been involved with religion and it was not a healthy relationship. And both ""religion"" and ""values"" can mean a million different things so it's impossible to generalize.

I know I don't want to see my son failing to thrive or survive in a difficult future because he was stifled by idealism or adherence to a set of values that are mainly just wishful thinking, divorced from the reality of life in a competitive and harsh environment. My own experience as a spiritual person who was trying to contribute to a spiritual community and do something on behalf of that community or even humanity is that it robbed me of opportunities and even my own vitality.

The problem with religion is that if you follow it too far it asks you to give your life away. The destination of religion is sainthood. Saints don't live for themselves. Whether that is a worthy goal depends entirely on the individual, but given my experience I chose to abandon that goal because I found it to be impossible to gauge whether any of it was at all worthwhile. All I knew was that I was giving my life increasingly away and winding up in worse and worse circumstances personally.

In the middle ground you have ""dabbling"" with religion which is what 99% of people do. They are interested in some facet - values, or social aspects, or trying to overcome some kind of guilt, trauma, etc. At this level it's mostly about gaining some kind of benefit or advantage. And if it starts to inhibit you in some way you'll probably abandon those ideas or commitments, barring some external pressure to maintain it (like being stuck in a religions culture). That sounds self-serving but look at extreme examples: if you suffer or die for ideas what are you really accomplishing? Would you want that for your kid?

So what I've arrived at is emphasizing pragmatism and the most broadly applicable skills about seeing what is really happening and responding to that in a self-enhancing, self-preserving way. Ultimately, that ends up being very red pill. But after all my travails with philosophies I have come to see this as simply the most intelligent way to exist in the world. That's not to say that I'm encouraging my kid to find ways to take advantage of others, but more so that the world is merciless and unforgiving. If you aren't protecting yourself and exploiting opportunity you will be harmed and disadvantaged. This seems somewhat at odds with mainstream religious values in our time.

The main values I'm reinforcing are self-reliance, discipline, observation, and problem solving. At the end of the day I'd rather see my kid live a life of survival, accomplishment, and success as opposed to charity, martyrdom, or asceticism. But at the same time, people have their own natures and his nature is what it is. Just like mine led me to go do things that had nothing to do with whatever my parents might have wished or expected, given their inputs. He may take all this and go do something completely unexpected. I just want him to do that from the best possible vantage point, I guess. I'm not sure religion will offer him that vantage point.",DannyMight,1,t1_cze7xar,2016-01-28 18:41:31

It's been my dream for years to homeschool my own children and give them a childhood that allows for true education, where the mind, body, and moral parts of a personal are cared for and developed. I want to raise children who enjoy challenges and love to live their lives as men and women who are courageous, critical thinkers, who use their strengths and personalities (I.e. They don't let real talents die due to complacency or fear), and who are confident and happy.

Waldorf looks nice on the surface, but the underlying philosophies of Rudolf Steiner and his esoteric religious beliefs are a combination of creepy woo woo bullshit 19th century and now-discredited racialist pseudoscience.  If your kid is white and blond they can do well at a Waldorf at least initially, brown kids (like mine) not so much. 

The whole delaying reading until age 7 thing is maybe workable if you live in remote agrarian community, but for those of us who live in the complex world of 21st century urban society it is absolutely necessary to start developing analytical and critical thinking skills as early as possible - Waldorf actively de-prioritises this.

I plan on teaching my son and/or daughter RP ways from the get-go. 

For a daughter modesty won't be an option (you can have great style and turn heads without wearing tight/revealing clothing imho), I will teach that sexism is terrible but gender roles are good, no woman should ever feel 'less than' for 'manning the fort' so to speak. Without a woman in my life, my home looks like shit, holidays aren't festive, if/when I have kids, they won't be as full and rich as if I were to raise them alone, the list is endless. Cooking/cleaning is used in sexist jokes by insecure men. Personally, one of the biggest turn-ons for me is coming into a kitchen with my girl doing something (cooking or cleaning). As such, I've been told several times that working on my car, or wearing my toolbelt during construction is a turn-on. I don't do it for a living, but knowing how to do it is a turn-on.

For a son, well I won't lie when I say I will know what to teach him more than I'd know what to teach a daughter of mine. I'd teach him that a full household is required to raise your best possible offspring, that maintaining health and looks aren't an option, etc. It all boils down to reproduction and your bloodline, so I'd teach him everything that I was taught, plus what I've learned up the point of 'our talk,' I guess..

Gaming the wife when he is around teasing, playing (G rated) with her, touching (G rated) her etc.  Getting shit done.  Expecting the same of him (and all family members) within what they can do at their age.  Even a 6 year old can empty garbages or deliver toilet paper to the bathroom, take their plate from the table etc.  When I am doing something mechanical or in the yard I invite him to help where possible and find other 'work' we can do together that is not just drudgery but learning.

Finally when we have had some time together I have tried to point out some key concepts with him.  Girls respond to your action.  They don't want 'whatever you want'.  Talking to him about lots of other things like women/girls and drama.  Mostly looking for situation examples where I can show him the RP concepts.

It isn't as rigid or structured as a school is. We can talk about *whatever* for 20 minutes or 2 hours depending on how he takes to it.

d9jgbzk,"Have you had a conversation with her about how your work is challenging and draining, and it would be a huge relief for you to come home and not have to clean up the dog's mess, or get on her case about her homework, etc?

I remember what it was like to be in middle school. Solipsism comes to a head, as you start to realize that adults *don't* know everything, but you're also starting to develop the ability to actually empathize. It causes a lot of internal confusion, and sometimes you need to be reminded that the world exists beyond what you personally experience. Middle school is also an awful place to go through this awful time, dealing with all your peers who are at the same stage of mental development as you.

She's probably the child-parent version of shit testing. She might be internalizing resentment towards you, in part because, as you mentioned, she's more sheltered than her friends. The ultimate goal for most people in middle school is to fit in, and having that massive gap between her and her friends is likely causing her emotional stress, which she's blaming you for and lashing out by testing your limits.

The other part of her likely resentment is the classic ""you can't possibly understand me,"" exacerbated by the fact that she doesn't directly have her mother to complain to about this. It might be a good idea to also talk to her about how you understand that she's going through changes that you don't have personal experience with, but you still want to support her.

My own disobedience towards my father in middle school largely stemmed from a growing feeling that, because he wasn't ""like me,"" I couldn't trust him with everything. Try to build your relationship so that she feels like she can confide in you, and she understands that every relationship needs give and take. You're doing your best to help her succeed, but you need her to help you too. 

Of course, maintain that she needs to respect you, and you are not willing to deal with her disobedience, but it will probably help to show her *why* she should respect you. It sounds like she doesn't respect the consequences you've set for her actions, so she might require a new approach.

Edit: Also, what are your reasons for sheltering her? From my experience dealing with people who were raised sheltered, it hampers their ability to find an identity that is their own. I haven't yet met a sheltered person whose life was made better by it, most of them are either still clueless about the world or managed to develop as a person **despite** being sheltered/after breaking free of their parents' control.",Green_Gables,2,t3_5atkry,2016-11-03 01:32:43
d9jyegj,"Well man,  my girls are 7 and 3, so I'm not there yet, but the wife and I talk about the teens constantly trying to prepare.  Even women agree, there is no preparation for a girl in her teens and yours essentially is.  We all know those years are very hard for the parents and much worse for the kid.  Not only is their body going nuts, their small society is too.  Who knows whats going on at school.  Pressures and social hierarchy.  To you and I, we know its all a sham and bullshit, but to her it is her world.  As hard as your job is and working way too many hours, she views her current situation as just as bad and most likely worse.  

The last way to get to her is a raised voice and strictness.  As tired and frustrated as you are, you are going to have to make a real effort to appeal to her emotions.  To me, this isn't about being RP or BP, but about being a good parent at this point.  Sure, use RP tendencies and lead her, but do so in a way to appeal to how she is feeling and what she is going through.  If it were a boy, you would have some of the same struggles here.  You will have to make a point to talk to her like an adult.  She believes she is an adult and ready to take on the world.  Tell her how life for you is and what you expect of her.  Show appreciation and use some positive reinforcement.  It sounds corny but do the whole compliment sandwich deal.  Lead with telling her how proud you are of anything she has done or accomplished, then speak on what you would like for her to improve on and to do to help you around the house.  Explain that you make her current life possible by all that you do and you need to be a team.  You need to be a team and life will be great.  Then exit with how much you love her and how you wouldn't want any other child as your own.   

I don't envy your position, but it's a very important time in her life.  Things that happen to her right now will mold how she expects life to be as an adult.  Plus you need to be a figure in her life that will depict the sorts of men she peruses as mates later on.  If you are constantly on her ass now, she may subconsciously pursue men that are emotionally or even physically abusive.  If you want to talk more hit me up.

dcmu4x9,"Heather Has Two Mommies is a book first published in 1989. It tells the story about this girl named Heather who has two cats, two dogs, two pens, two pencils, two mommies, two pillows, two TVs, and she lives on lollipop lane in a gumdrop house having an excellent life.

One day, Heather goes to school, and the teacher is doing a lesson about what my daddy does for a living, and Heather starts to cry because she doesn't have a daddy. But then it turns out that the little black boy has two daddies, the little hispanic boy just lives with his mommy, the token white boy has some other non-standard family situation, and it's all cool because they're all families and everybody's equal and shit. I was really offended that they didn't have any students in wheelchairs or any native american kids represented in the book. Fucking bigots.

Personally, I am 100% in favor of educating our children about social issues. And right now, sexuality is a huge social issue. So if people want to teach their kids ""This is what gay is, and this is why gay is okay. This is what transsexuality is, and this is why transsexuality is okay."" and so on, that's totally fine.

But when messages like this are not presented overtly, but are instead slipped insidiously into children's books and posters intended for children, we're not teaching our kids that alternate sexualities are okay. We're teaching our kids that sexuality isn't even an issue. Some people have two cats, two pencils, two mommies, two pillows, and two ovens. Some girls have a barbie doll, a pet goldfish, a Playstation 4, a penis, and Monopoly Junior. Some boys have a pet dog, a remote control truck, a vagina, a snowcone machine, and a TV in their room.

It's criminal to try to indoctrinate children into a mindset that sexuality isn't an issue. Sexuality is probably the hugest social issue of our time, second only to abortion. If we want to educate our kids directly about sexuality and why alternate sexualities are okay or not, that's great. But trying to insidiously indoctrinate kids into thinking that a girl having a penis is no different than a girl having a pet dog or a teddy bear and that this is totally not even an issue is essentially making our kids ignorant of the real world. It's shit parenting. Might as well not teach your kids how to read or do math either, if you're not going to teach your kids other real issues.",Archwinger,5,t3_5ox9pz,2017-01-19 15:06:09

Presenting current issues and making sure you kid knows what hot topics are is important. Maybe I am more closed minded than I make myself out to be. Its difficult to even create an open dialogue about these things sometimes because by the subtelties of terminology we have to tip toe around...

I started typing a response ""Say you have a daughter"", and all i could think of was potential responses... ""Well did you condition her to be a girl because she was born with a vagina?"" ""How do you know your child isnt a boy who has a vagina?""

Vagina = girl can be an offensive assumption to some. But it shouldn't be. If an innocent kid sees another kid who looks like a typical boy, is he wrong to assume its a boy?

It does make a big difference.  Now what I think most don't talk about though is that there are generally changes to rules and how they are applied with regards to the kids.  My ex would hardly follow the rules that I had established for the kids whenever they went to visit her.  Even though consistency was specifically directed in the parenting plan.  So I just held to the parenting plan for most major things and the rest was fairly minor and just dealt with whatever fallout there was with the kids regarding those situations.  Also for any major communication tried to get it from her directly.

As for dealing with her directly, is a tough one either way.  My ex even though we have been apart for quite some time was still able to get me going about something that really shouldn't have engaged in on occasion.

All while she was the violent and abusive one.  I had to prove my innocence and fight her in court and now have 50/50 custody of my son.  It cost me a small fortune in legal fees.

Hopefully you are still journalling everything you can.  She might be ok for now, but she might go crazy later.  Log things like pick up and drop offs.  Money spent on the kids.  Medical visits.  Anything that makes you look good or makes her look bad.

In dealing with her, amused mastery is your friend.  Don't text her when you are upset.  Wait until you are calm. I encourage you to ignore her entirely if says anything that isn't related to the kids.  

Remember, the moment you get upset = she wins.  The moment you let her know you're upset = she wins even more.  The more she wins, the harder your life will be.

Initiate communications with her as little as possible.  Try to stay off her radar.  That said, don't appear weak in any way.",youcantdenythat,2,t3_5viy9d,2017-02-22 16:20:29

dea24aq,"turns out is kind of a natural process, but yes I would say that getting him in shape is 80% of it. My kid may not be as advanced as other kids in that department but I would say He is ok on that field.

If you can find a sport he likes (any sport) its a great help.",Vasallo7G,2,t3_5wg3tq,2017-02-27 13:03:34
dea4y7v,Co-ed sports?  A few guys on your original thread suggested dance class.  I was initially skeptical but odds are he would be the only guy in a room full of girls.  It would be hard not to talk to them.  I would have never thought of that approach.  I was hoping for more ideas like that. ,super_sweeper,1,t1_dea24aq,2017-02-27 13:58:29
dea5ax5,"unfortunately this question is can't be answered with a generalization.  In other words, a few things needs to happen here.

First, he needs to experience plenty of failure.  He needs to learn how to pickup after himself when he fails.  He needs to learn how to take defeat or rejection and become better through it due to evolving through that specific problem.  Because it sounds like his fear is the standard unwarranted fear of being turned down by girls, and he feels more comfortable staying in the basement surrounded by comfortable things like his video games, or whatever he does.  This is a life lesson, not necessarily a dating lesson, because he needs to learn to walk before he can run.

Second, he needs exposure to girls.  He needs to join groups and clubs and sports teams.  He doesn't need to ask everyone out on a date, but the mere exposure to girls doing teamwork things, will adjust his view on girls and evolve his communication abilities towards girls.",SirAttackHelicopter,3,t3_5wg3tq,2017-02-27 14:05:07
deaqtvu,This is good advice.  I think coping with rejection of any kind is the best life lesson you can teach a child. ,manlydudebro,1,t1_dea5ax5,2017-02-27 20:41:10

dfmisq0,"He is still 11 years old, i don't think his interest for women have developed yet, correct me if wrong please.

I would suggest you educate him to be goal oriented, set short team and medium term goals, then break it into smaller goals and help him achieve it, you could keep a journal in which both could write what you think, or write the progress. This whole ACHIEVER, GO GET IT mindset will effortlessly attract women, he won't have to seek women, it's gonna be the opposite.",TryhardPantiesON,2,t3_5wg3tq,2017-03-30 19:17:56

She even accused me of being ""controlling"" because I had organized her cupboards. I'm wondering if she's just hormonal and easily triggered. And I'm hoping that once the baby is born she will return to normal but I can't count on that. I'm preparing myself. She even wants to name the kid without asking me.
