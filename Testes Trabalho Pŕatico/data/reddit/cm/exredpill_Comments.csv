chibx7j,"Personally, I think the best way redpillers could move on is to show them that not everybody has had the same experience as you did, much like what I went through. Being surrounded by so many people with so many stories really opened my eyes, and not just to feministic idea either. I'm sure that many redpillers are just ""beta"" guys in their 20's who want to be ""alpha,"" so they hit the gym, degrade women because they got dumped, and separate men into two categories based on their mannerisms alone. They obviously aren't seeing that people's actions are based on their pasts, how and why is up to your imagination.

What's the best way to show TRPers that women have their own story? I can't answer that specifically, because they're so unwilling to hear other's opinions. It took a good friend and a bout of popularity to wake me up, but not everybody's in High School, nor may they have good friends or popularity.

chic9k5,"Actually, not that many people sent up red flags, at least not major ones. That's the advantage to going to a small school of ~500 students: the hive mind crushes all opposition. In this case, the hive mind is very liberal and very feminist anybody who is a tad bit misogynistic gets called out on it almost immediately. The crew I hung out with were *somewhat* misogynistic, but a far cry from TRP bad. Even I didn't feel the need to overcompensate for my lack of sex, I just really didn't like party girls.

While I didn't specifically see women as objects, I definitely saw them as inferior to men. Men had all the achievements. Men were better in war. Men aren't ruled by emotions. Men, men, men, men, men. 
A big part of the transformation was definitely me maturing. I went from being this shy misogynistic ass to the progressive social butterfly I call myself today. I wish I could say that I don't sexualize women, but I can't. I'm an 18 year old boy in a public school. It's just nature running its course.

chizyww,"Speaking of bible belt, to me, TRPers and the TWPwomen are the next generation of neoconservatives and their Ann Romneys. There is a strong emphasis on traditional gender roles, which to me is simply moralizing bullshit said to make themselves feel better about being rejected by women and longing for days gone by where they could practice psychopathy (dark triad) without consequence.  Or for aimless women looking for an MRS degree (not that there is anything wrong with that, but its weird to build a community around it). 

You seem to agree most of the sub and their opinions are bullshit, and until that changes, I will continue to judge the entire philosophy as bullshit. And I can't speak to the early days of trp, but I do know that pretty much all the mods of TRP are fucking lunatics.

Of the generalizations TRP touts, I will agree than generally, women do like someone who is a leader, confident in himself, and not reliant on women for their happiness, and ""outcome independent""...of course, this isn't always the case, but lets assume it is.  None of these facts lead me to any of the other conclusions they seem to reach about women. In fact, I respect women more, since I find these traits admirable in both men and women. 

I also find it odd that, for men who supposedly are so outcome independent, they spend hours a day discussing how to make women like them.  Talk about beta. I got into the seduction community many years ago, learned a bit, and moved on. Once you understand the basics, I don't see a reason to continue being involved in the community.  Its fairly simple to have sex with random girls.  Sure, who doesn't like getting laid? But spending hours online talking about it is just so useless. 

TRP essentially stripped away the positive lessons of Seddit/seduction and replaced them with neoconservatism and misogyny as ways to build themselves up in case they fail. 

&gtThe cock carousel is post BF slutiness. Once a girl lost her virginity to her BF she will fuck around.  Hypergamy is all around, you will understand that when you make out with a girl and see her BF crying 5 minutes later.

This is just bullshit IMO, men are much more likely to be hypergamous.  Yes, some women cheat on their boyfriends with the next alpha that comes along--these women are fucking idiots, just as their male counterparts are.",absolutebeginners,9,t1_chiv1jn,2014-05-15 19:07:09

I used to be the opposite, i used to hate men. I've had a slew of terrible fathers and was terrified of men as a child. That carried into my teenage years.

My questions are.... How does someone who might be a terper interact with random women? I'm  talking about women that they aren't interested in fucking. Just everyday people that they have to talk to. Would you have tried to push your ideas down their throat? Or would you for the most part act normal? 

I ask because i have met many guys (in the real world) who sometimes say redpillish things. Not too much though. Something like, 'women are emotion based. And they're also turned on by emotional connection.' 
I can never figure out if it's a hint to their terpishness of if it's innocent ignorance. 

Also as an ex-redpiller, what advice would you give a woman in dealing with real life redpillers? Ignore them? Correct them? Mock their ideas? Im looking for the most effective way to show the  that women are not inferior.

chkir2p,"I would say that there were different degrees of TRPers. Some are guys who overcompensate by going to the gym and being sexist. Some are the guys who got screwed by a girls once or twice in their life. Some are the guys who don't like how *women base things on emotion.* Some of these people would definitely look down on women, and others really couldn't give two shits if he wasn't interested. The ""alpha male"" would most likely be the one to shove their ideas down a woman's throat, whereas the ""beta"" male"" would be the least likely. Personally, I didn't approach anybody with my ideas, I kept them all bottled up inside, for the most part. Whether this is healthier than the alternative is up for debate. 

To be honest, I'm not sure what advice I could give you. I know I'm being really useless here, but I'd rather not mislead you. I wouldn't recommend mocking them or correcting them, as both might be a bit hard for their superior male brains to understand, but I would certainly give them the classic ""1-2-Fuck You"" middle finger and a fuck you.

My question, is, as an Eurasian guy, how do you feel about the often tense interracial-dating discussions on that sub? Specifically concerning Asian Men(and their lack of luck in America) and Asian women? I'm a bit bothered that asianmasculinity is a subreddit here, one that has probably arisen as a reaction to certain phenomena, as well as an internalization of TRP, unfortunately. 

One thing that's been bothering me for a while, is the over-representation of Asian men among non-whites in both TRP and the dork enlightenment at large. Even r/asianamerican has a few of these guys, :/

Honestly my knee-jerk reaction is to say the entire discussion is completely stupid and ignorant and that they have no right to say those things until they've at least been in an interracial relationship.

I really wish there was a way to let someone know how absurdly racist they sound over the internet. Oh man the generalizations... 

It would make my day if one of the people in those discussions admitted they feel the same way about an Asian Woman-White Man couple as an old Southern White guy when he sees a Black Man and White Woman together as a couple. Because growing up in the South, I heard a lot of the same crappy attitudes and arguments. Just change the races appropriately.

The same cognitive dissonance that's talked about in /r/TheBluePill. Excluding that, the same reasons why a guy of any other race would buy into it: insecurities about their dating life and sense of manhood. They want to fix these issues but don't realize how toxic TRP is. Also, did Asian culture in any way contribute to those insecurities? No, it was their family's own culture and that person's choices that did it. The media? Not enough to matter. 

When I lived in Japan and Taiwan I met plenty of very manly, very masculine and very confident guys. They weren't abandoning their culture in pursuit of masculinity. They embodied the Japanese or Taiwanese idea of a manly man. One guy I'm friends with was a former Taiwanese equivalent to a Navy SEAL. None of them talked about it like it was special either. This is also excluding the AA male jocks I've met over the years and the AA guys who were just confidently themselves. Any guy who talks about being manly probably has some insecurities about it. 

Really though, your description of the issue is enough to show the absurdity of PoCs following TRP.

But are we really being fair in saying that the opportunity is equal? Standards may be equal, but funding is certainly not and that matters. As do personal imperatives such as familial support, diet, and housing. Instilling the reality of work with a monetary reward at a young age might not be such a bad idea for children who were born with some kind of social/economic disadvantage- as long as there are regulations and oversight. A lot of families make it a point to reward chores/good grades with money to instill it's value and the child's confidence in their abilities- businesses could offer the same mentoring.

cihtlay,"I will work on a larger post for the sub.  However I will say this, there are certain aspects to TRP that are toxic for men.  Any ideology that teaches men that women are too risky, too hypergamous, etc, to marry and have a family with is flawed.  Spinning plates for men is the male equivalent of women slutting it up in their 20's.  You will not find long term satisfaction there.

I am conservative and patriotic by nature, I don't want to continue to see the birth rate of our society drop.  One need only look at Japan to see the devastating effects that happen when a society collectively rejects reproduction.  Immigration is nothing more than offshoring or own duty to reproduce and perpetuate our society, our values, our traditions, etc.

Therefore, I find concepts like women are incapable of loving like a man toxic and counterproductive.  I also know it's not true from my own experience.  TRP suffers from a tremendous amount of selection bias, so their anecdotal evidence is skewed.  A RPWoman pointed this out to me, and it absolutely makes sense.  The costs of making TRP a safe place to call women whores, sluts, cunts, etc, outweigh the benefits (depedestalization).

My vision for change in our society would look very much like the Dutch model, which is post-feminist or 4th wave.  There women have largely rejected full time employment and rampant consumerism which has resulted in a net increase in life satisfaction and sufficient free time for reproduction and raising children.  And TRP is not going to get us there.  It will in fact bolster the oppositional forces within feminism to dig in deeper and resist change.

So in rejecting TRP I don't embrace feminism in it's current incarnation.  Quite the contrary, yet I see TRP as the impediment to societal progress and evolution.  And after analyzing the evidence in great detail, I find insufficient reason to embrace it as a whole on a purely analytical level.

The powerful and unquestioned  message, right now in our culture, is ""junk food is your right."" Nobody ever says that, exactly, and yet it hold many times as much sway as the thing everybody says: ""I shouldn't eat junk food"". Right now we have feminism saying women should enter the workplace, and those messages stick out and feel very conspicuous. That's because there are a million tiny, unnoticed messages every day to us that men should work and women, whatever, work isn't their thing. To call such an environment ""the absence of social pressure"" is shockingly inaccurate. More unfortunate is, if you don't recognize that this conditioning exists, you attribute differing genders' behavior as somehow due to biology. Which only reinforces the difference and makes it harder (less acceptable) for people to do things that defy gender roles.

If you create a society like the Dutch have in which women can do whatever they want and have near zero social stigma attached to their choice, whether that be part time employment, full time SAHM, or full time career, then people will naturally fall into whatever category makes them happy.  If you feel the Dutch are regressing and socially shaming women to stay out of the workforce, I'd love to see some evidence.  I don't think it exists.

Lastly, it's not just women that are increasingly opting for part time employment among the Dutch.  It's men too, as stated in the original article.  Our society places a high emphasis on materialism and consumption.  Subsequently, there is social pressure to succeed regardless of gender, and that means working very hard at times.  But there has to be a balance to achieve life satisfaction.  That's part of the basis for the French law which mandates the 35-hour work week.

You wouldn't appreciate being told that your biology makes you naturally more suited to a limited role in society. (I see this as equivalent to saying that women are designed to be mothers.) This argument doesn't strike me as nearly different enough from ""women shouldn't be in positions of power, because what if they PMS and end up nuking China!"" 

For a woman trying to succeed in a male-dominated area, repeated messages that she is biologically unsuited for the job are extremely hurtful and even shaming. And those messages are already omnipresent, all the time, even in enlightened Western European countries. A woman succeeding in business or science or politics is already succeeding *despite* those messages, which may be less visible than the message of ""girl power!"" but are vastly, vastly more powerful. And the fact that women are being turned away from these fields means they stay majority-male and people continue atrributing it to biology -- ""women would just rather be mothers."" I mean when you think about it, being good at being a mother doesn't make you bad at business, does it? There's no logical connection between the two.

Wait,I got one. Suppose very poor people developed a trait where they got an explosion of endorphins after eating off-brand mac and cheese. Let's even say it's inheritable. Wouldn't your argument then say that poor people are just naturally designed to eat that brand, and so we should just let them do it because the body knows best? I realize it's not equivalent in that my example is man-made, but the idea of hormones as what should dictate behavior, especially different behavior between groups, is very troubling. In fact, any argument connecting biology to the way different groups/classes of people behave, without considering how much of it is due to socialized expectations, would have an uphill battle in the scientific community. Partially because of the logic itself, and partially because it's been the rationale of every eugenicist in history.",captainlavender,24,t1_cimvrsu,2014-07-03 00:21:04
cin8qhl,"&gtwomen can do whatever they want and have near zero social stigma

I am extremely confident this is not the case. It's not the case anywhere in the world.

&gtpeople will naturally fall into whatever category makes them happy

Sometimes a society doesn't shame people for making unconventional choices but bestows extra approval on people who make conventional/ acceptable choices. That extra approval can be enough to change a lot of people's minds, and it of course arises from defined gender roles. ""I could be a businesswoman... or I could be a mom and make my family and my husband's family happy and have lots of mom friends."" There's more going on than the simple choice between homemaking and seeking a career. And to continue this idea

&gtIf you feel the Dutch are regressing and socially shaming women to stay out of the workforce, I'd love to see some evidence.

It's not regressing. Gender expectations still exist and have never stopped existing. Right now progress is being made, which I am very happy about. But lack of public shaming does not mean there are no social norms keeping people in their place.

&gtLastly, it's not just women that are increasingly opting for part time employment among the Dutch. It's men too, as stated in the original article.

However, not everything in TRP is necessarily wrong, which makes it seductive to the end user.  If you're savvy enough to take the pieces that are helpful to your life and move on to find a suitable LTR, so be it.  If you're one of these guys that has sworn off LTRs because of X, Y, and Z, you are lost as fuck and need to re-examine your thought process.

Rodgers was infected by much of the same rhetoric you and others believe in, that is a fact.  He just ended up hating players as much as women, and thinking women were flawed biologically programmed creatures (not people) because they were attracted to them.

TRP clearly suffers from selection bias IMO, therefore they extrapolate anecdotes to being factual and easily generalized.  I maintain women can love just as much as a man, and you can't prove this is wrong.  My experiences are just as relevant as yours.  

It's one thing to recognize hypergamy exists and take appropriate steps to protect yourself, but it's quite another to say all or most women are hypergamous post-wall beta users out to divorce rape anybody gullible enough to marry them.  These thought patterns are not healthy for the individual or the society, and will not lead to long term satisfaction.

TRP likes to talk about reaching a state of acceptance, moving past the anger.  Moving past anger is fine, but acceptance of such ideas is not the solution.  Sexual strategy is not amoral, knowingly harming a person physically or emotionally on purpose is not moral.  TRP needs to have more respect for what they don't know.  As someone who has studied these issues in depth and actually searched for the evidence in many academic research papers, there is sufficient reason to doubt many tenets of RP/manosphere philosophy.",[deleted],13,t1_cino2k7,2014-07-03 17:06:55

&gtFalse Confidence is what TRP gives you. It places the blame for YOUR failures and YOUR shortcomings on women (even though they adamantly claim otherwise).  

TRP actually emphasises the importance of SMV, thus telling you to work on yourself in order to fix the problem whether it's through lifting weights, reading, or learning a new skill or language.

2. I have come to realize that women are indeed ""the most responsible teenager"" (they need to emotionally connect with the children they need to take care of).

3. Most girls i know lust after alpha figures. Trp kinda teaches how to be (or fake, if you will, being) an alpha. Lust does not mean an LTR. But it does mean sex right now.

4. Most anti TRP attack the ""anger against women"" part of trp. But thats just a phase. And this phase is where people get very vocal and put up posts. Most trpers soon grow out of that phase and realize its pointless to post anymore cuz they soon imbibe the DNGAF attitude and see women as humans.

If TRP helped you depedestalize women, great.  However, internalizing false narratives about women, like them being incapable of loving like a man or unconditionally is counterproductive and toxic for both the individual and the society.  What if your dad had concluded the same about your mom?

You sound young so I will simply say that you are too young to make such generalizations.  Young people tend to be immature, that's a fact.  As they accumulate life experience that changes.  I'm not disagreeing with you, only saying you suffer from [selection bias](http://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/2buqw4/to_what_extent_is_trp_based_on_the_following/).

&gtMost girls i know lust after alpha figures. Trp kinda teaches how to be (or fake, if you will, being) an alpha. Lust does not mean an LTR. But it does mean sex right now.

See [The Alpha Male Myth](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/07/07/the-myth-of-the-alpha-male/).  Also, selection bias again.

&gtMost anti TRP attack the ""anger against women"" part of trp. But thats just a phase. And this phase is where people get very vocal and put up posts.

And since they DNGAF anymore they post less on TRP and so we see less from these guys. TRP is littered with posts from guys who are still angry and vocal.

It is a phase for some.  Some never outgrow their hatred of women, therefore I argue it's counterproductive to make TRP such a friendly place for such hatred to fester and reinforce itself, like racism on a KKK forum.  If black people feel inferior to white people, should they then depedestalize white people by making up nonsense about them?  No, again, it's counterproductive and toxic.

&gtAn LTR does not seem a very attractive option to the ones who'd rather spin plates. TRP is more suited for guys looking to play the game than for the guys looking for love.

TRP is well suited to very immature men, emotionally and cognitively, period.  Hopefully as you grow older you will see the false dichotomy for what it is.  Women are awesome people.  Yes there are people that you should avoid.  And on that score TRP is not completely wrong, that's what makes it seductive.

ckcilys,"Feminism as an academic focus grew out of feminism the social movement. This movement was a modern response of women to the disparities imposed upon them in every day life for a pretty long time. Men have never really been in that situation. Ever. There has never been a need for men to gather, for the sake of being men, an march down the streets demanding the right to vote, equal treatment in employment, the right to own property, the right to hold public office etc. 

There may be disparities in outcomes for men in some limited circumstances due to legal, political, and business answers to feminist concerns. Not unlike a white student not gaining college admission due to affirmative action policies. These do not affect *all* men, half of the population, in their every day life. The imperative, the social need, the social harm just isnt there on the scale as it is, and was, for women. If mens studies had the same egalitarian goals as feminism, it would probably be hard to even tell them apart, they would be looking at the same things and making the same arguments. 

When you read 'mens studies' type material, it seems to focus on nitpicking those sorts of things, and overlooking the broad scope of feminism, to make its men as victims argument out of nothing but red herrings. 'Poor me' That seems to be the whole purpose. When you look at the history of feminism and the general tenants of feminism, its more about bringing Everyone to the table, on equal footing. Its a 'lets do this together' kind of thing. Its not just about women. Its about how *everyone* is harmed when one group is left out. The solutions might not be perfect. The idea of women as being worthy of equal respect in society and under the law is a pretty new thing overall, and there are actual disparities that society is trying to respond to.

Women experience a fundamentally different society than men. A good comparison is the America that blacks experience vs the America that whites experience, especially when it comes to interacting with police in white communities vs black communities. Completely different interfaces. Though I think it is fair to say that women, as a group, have come a bit further than the black population in social and legal disparity. Look at any group that has been historically oppressed, youll find African American Studies, LGBT Studies, American Indian Studies, Jewish American Studies and on and on and on. 

Just talk to some women. Ask them how they feel about walking down the street, into shops, in the workplace in relation to how men are viewed and treated. Redpill promotes the behaviors and ideas that women have to face head on daily. Daily degradation and debasement. Instead of seeing them as 'females' why not view them as humans with names and families and lives and interests and desires and struggles, just like 'males'. 

Men rule the world. Feminism isnt an attack on men, as the redpill community would like people to believe. Mens studies, in the form of redpill articles, really is an expression of patriarchy struggling to maintain power. The general purpose seems to be to discredit any concerns 'females' might have, invalidate them, and trivialize the reality of being female into oblivion. It seems to be working. Ask most people what they think feminism is, and theyll say something about misandry, and how they oppose feminism. The philosophy is appealing, and used by typically bitter and frustrated young men who have not had much success with women, for whatever reason. They adopt the philosophy to cope with feelings of emasculation, inadequacy, inferiority, fear of rejection, fear of intimacy. It is very clear when you read redpill material that these are men who havent spent much time with women, who dont know women as human beings. Men who dont want to know women as human beings. Thats a bit different from the purposes and goals of feminism. Even more shallow than their understanding of 'females' is their antiquated and juvenile concept of masculinity. Feminisms goal is to bring women to the same level as men, not debase them. Its not Male vs Female. 

Sorry for the unorganized rant. Why do you believe that mens studies isnt as prominent as womens studies? Why do you believe there is a need for mens studies? What focus should it entail that isnt already covered in womens studies or advocated for in general feminist ideology or other areas of sociological inquiry and philosophical thought?

ckckquj,"Look, I am not responding to your rant - and it isn't because I do not respect you as a person. I have been through this argument too many times already to try to change your mind.

I do not understand why you, and others, feel the need to rant about the necessity of feminism - why do you think it is OK to do that, rather than simply respond to my questions?

Did you not think I was sincere? 

I think I have been clear that I already understand the necessity for feminism both historically and in contemporary society - I just see it as fundamentally one-sided.

Personally, I am looking for a cause that is truly egalitarian.

The challenge for me is getting an honest conversation started. A rant like yours garners support from women, white knights, and the lazy majority no matter where you post it. Whereas, in every sphere of media where I am not anonymous, I have to be careful not to express mere questions about a gender-neutral egalitarian movement.

How sad is that? More importantly, why is that? I would argue it is because feminism itself is now an institution that is deeply entrenched in our society and which lords over our ethics and exploits that power to silence critics, much in the same omnipresent way that patriarchy is purported to act.

Just look at where I have to turn to say these things - If I express my views on Facebook, LinkedIn, or other social media channels, I have to fear for my career, my relationships, and both my reputation and that of anyone associated with me.

What kind of free and open dialogue is that, anyway? I am concerned for the world I am bringing my kids into, and I am afraid that our daughters will end up feminists and our sons will end up homeless junkies with no social support.

Whats wrong with feminism as a societal institution, if feminism is just the idea that women should be treated equally? Unless youve bought in to some other idea of what feminism is? 

If feminism is just the idea that women should be respected equally in society, what is the problem with your daughter being a feminist? It seems like you are trying hard to define feminism as something it is not, and you arent even really making it clear what you think feminism is other than some kind of vague catastrophic threat against humans with male genitalia. What does homeless junkie sons have anything to do with what was being discussed? Seriously..

Feminism *does not* ignore men, or families, or boys. It just focuses on the female experience. Is it one-sided for a husband to march down the street with his wife and daughter, expressing his desire for them to be treated with the same level of respect in society that he enjoys? Men and boys are very much a part of everything about feminism. 

If you understand the unfortunate history of 'females' in society, a unique and significant experience of a group of people, based entirely on the fact that they have vaginas, then I don't see why you should have any trouble with a school of thought focusing on just that. Just because Ive focused my microscope in on an amoeba and Im writing a paper about it, it doesnt mean that Im ignoring or neglecting the fact that that amoeba shares a space with other organisms and interacts with them in a broad ecological system. A particle physicist is still keenly aware that particles are parts of wholes.

Which is unfortunate, and a bit ironic, considering the egalitarian nature of broad feminism thought and its history.  

This goes back to my previous Christian/Muslim comment. I think some people make rigid black and white assumptions like 'Feminist therefore against men.' But if feminism is just an idea about egalitarian mutual respect, and a justified social and academic focus on the shitty, or awesome, reality of what it means to be 'female', then it is just part of a broader whole, and such popular ideas as 'Feminism as exclusion' is just a popular misconception. 

'Feminism' seems to me more of a specialization than a rejection or denial or exclusion. If I have a tooth issue, Im going to see a dentist, not my general practitioner.

Women cannot always receive more public support than men, nor more private funding as prescribed by the feminist ethic in its past and present affect.

They see what is branded as feminism, a vocal minority, in a negative light, and reject identification with feminism. 

There was a similar thing I saw happen in the 90s where people distanced themselves from the LGBT equality movement because mostly what they saw were outlandish clips of pride parades and events on tv, and they didnt feel it represented them and didnt want to be associated with it. Gay guys began to refuse to call themselves 'gay'. And with the equality movement, the solution there was not to highlight differences, as the strategy had been for decades, but for people to see gays as 'people too'. 

The playing field has leveled quite a bit. Its less pressing now, and many of the modern issues of feminism are more nuanced, less apparent. Not being able to vote or own property is something anyone can relate to. How can a man really relate to feeling like a piece of meat, or just a sex object, every time they walk down the street and having their day completely ruined by that? We dont have to go through anything like what women do to get a job, as far as appearances go. Ive been in college for 7 years now, and I see guys predictably treat women as if they exist solely to please them. I think many of the issues are on an interpersonal level like that and just not as readily apparent and the best solution is truly an egalitarian one: Pointing out that women are People too. 

On services, I dont know specifically what you are referring to but here are my thoughts. I prefer to look at it not as women receiving services, but as Families receiving services. A good example behind my reasoning is that nearly half of foodstamp dollars benefit children directly, though it might be easier to focus on the women's names on the EBT cards (and the resulting mental images of Welfare Queens), who make up a higher share than men.

ckd3vd4,"Well, my gripe with that is that when asked about the friendzone as it relates to women being rejected by men, she said that it was created by men as an excuse to not sleep with women that wanted to date/enter into a relationship/have sex.

When she overheard one of my classmates (a guy) grumbling about his recent rejection as a prom date (with a girl), she immediately jumped on him, attacking the concept of the friendzone, and how ""you all [boys/men] need to stop thinking of us [girls/women] as inconsequential and unwavering sex.""

What truly angered me was the fact that she so blatantly held one sex as higher than the other, yet claimed that she believed in a series of ideals so rooted in equality. I think that the concept of the friendzone holds *some* truth (I'm not going to get into why, other than the fact that some, if not many, pairs of people simply do not mesh well when in non-platonic relationships), but whether you believe in it or not, you should at least realize that it's the same for both sexes.

Similarly, if you subscribe to the equally baseless doctrine that a 77-100 wage gap exists, large parts of the more vitriolic, Dworkin-esque feminism becomes justified.

It relies on a zero sum-game thought, where men have it worse now, because women have it better. Ultimately, it's not interested in helping men its interest is in hurting women. That's why most of the conversations in those circles are about stopping feminism.

Feminists are the people who are actually doing something for- or studying how men are hurt by sexist thinking and sexist institutional power structures. That's why gender studies and sociologists use feminist theories to explain and come up with solutions for, for example, how to stop men from being crushed under ridiculous and unreasonable demands about what it means to be a ""Real Man"". An ideal that apparently involves killing yourself at a very high frequency, increased chances of homelessness and general feelings of inadequacies and depression.

The most well-treated slave is privileged in comparison to others slaves, but he or she is still a slave. That's why feminism has predominately focused on women. But that isn't done to the exclusion of men. To focus on something because you think it's more important or more urgent isn't the same as ignoring something else - if you work to improve conditions for homeless people in America, that doesn't mean you suddenly don't give a shit about homeless people in Asia.

Strongly emotionally claiming that women are in more fear of non-sexual violence than men despite the reality being the opposite - is just as crazy. That's not a fringe theory of feminism.

ckph07z,"&gt Now that I understand what Feminism really is (simply equality), I also understand that this teacher should likely be classified as simply an asshole. Feminism should never be, and will never be what she believed in.

The conservative side of things has termed this the ""motte and bailey"" approach after a the medieval structure of the same thing.

What happens is that feminists go out and advocate for one-sided power and such. When confronted that they're doing it, they fall back on the ""no, no, no - feminism is about equality!"" approach. They start telling you that that's not ""real"" femism, get you to feel bad about how they're being ""attacked"", etc etc etc.

Once you give up, they then just go back to advocating for the same one-sided power they were before.  
- Feminism is about equality! - but I want to talk about women being the victims of violence, but when you bring up men I will get angry at you or change the subject as quickly as possible.  
- Feminism is about equality! - but when a man commits violence against women the victim will be a ""woman"", but when a man commits violence against other men the victims will be described as ""people"", as to carefully cast men who commit crimes as ""men"" but men who are victims as anonymous beings who aren't that important.  
- Feminism is about equality! - it will get angry at a description of history that says that men made most of the accomplishments because women weren't allowed to, but it will say that it's just and fair to rewrite history to only talk about men as villains and women as victims (the patriarchy) despite real history involving men being mostly both the villains and men being the victims.

Feminism has always been about a slightly less extreme version of what woman has believed. It's simply a matter of how much. Some feminists (call it group #1) are simply one-sided - caring about their own desires more than others. This is not entirely equal, but it is typical of how the american system works, you have two groups with equal power who battle things out and end up reaching a balance.

Then you have feminists who make up the core of mainstream feminist theory who aggressively demonize men (call this group #2). ""the patriarchy"" ""rape culture"" etc etc etc - they take real facts, and twist them so that the man is always the villain, and the women is always the victim.

After that you have the actual radicals who believe stuff like that ""all heterosexual sex is rape"", and things that most feminists don't agree with. Call this group #3.

The thing is, group #1 still promotes the ideas that they don't fully process that come from group #2 and group #3. Very nice, caring women will still believe in ""the patriarchy"" and ""he just wants sex"" ideas that demonize men and sex. In general, feminism is group #2. But none of these groups is actually about equality. 

TRP is is not really any better, but it's not really any worse either. The difference is simply that it's more direct. It doesn't spend as much time spinning tales and manipulating the system to achieve it's goals. It's easier to see what it's doing, but it's doing the same thing.

ckpk3wp,"&gt Still, I do feel comfortable in observing that overall, feminism has done less harm than ""red pill"" philosophies. 

The thing is, TRP is like the male role in society - direct. Feminism is like the female role in society - indirect. Tracking down harm from TRP is easier to do, tracking down harm from feminism takes a lot more work and is a lot fuzzier.

TRP doesn't really advocate for issues in the real world, but let's say it started getting people fired if they disagreed with the idea that women are biologically programmed to follow a man because evolution, etc etc. That would be pretty crappy, right?

But feminism **has** actually done it's equivalent in the real world - gotten people fired for disagreeing with feminist thoughts. But they're better at appearing like they're pursuing an acceptable reason, and they're better at spinning things. You can be attacked for something like ""boys are better at math because boys enjoy math and the social isolation that comes with it"" despite it being true (in my opinion, but again and again I see this being the case).

Feminism does the same thing as TRP, they're just better at putting a sweet candy coating over the top of it. For example, the risk of TRP is that deranged people take it in a way where they attack women. But feminism is not actually better - feminism would just have deranged women tell the police that the sex they wanted last night was ""rape"", and have the police throw you in jail because of it under some ""if she says she was attacked you go to jail unless you can conclusively prove otherwise"" law that that would like to see passed.

Essentially I was the poster child for what people make to be the strawman of the redpill, young, fat, virgin, college-aged, social anxious, and depressed. To say I wasn't a people person was the understatement of the century.(And still kind of is)

I found theredpill and MGTOW in and of themselves to be fascinating philosophies with a new take on reality. It was so radical to what I had dealt with in my liberal upbringing that I had to take a look. I got hooked. I got really into it for a while and had a couple thousand karma.

I actually found mainstreams PUAs to be generally more tolerable then their redpill compatriots(particularly older PUAs, the new generation is worse) PUAs in my opinion are doing a good service, even if they are assholes, young guys need a map for how to get women. 

Here's my advice for how to get women and make friends with tons of cool people(I'll save you hundreds of hours of reading trp bullshit)

1) Eat right and exercise

2) Try and talk to at least one new person a day

3) Try and watch things that make you happy(comedy or even tv).

4) Cut back on watching the news and things that upset you.

5) Join lots of clubs in college(and afterward) to make friends.

6) Ignore people with miracle cures.

7) Be patient, all of these things will take time to create meaningful results.

8) Don't allow yourself to be walked on in relationships and work.

9) Be the one who initiates and asks the girl out, always do this via a phone call or in person. I can't believe I ever trusted that ""text game"" bullshit. Women unilaterally hate that. It's better to shit your pants then die of constipation. 

10) Pay close attention to what people say to make engaging conversation

11) Try and copy people's body language and make strong eye contact, it'll make people like you a lot more. 

12) Start now. Not next week. Not next month. Not a New Years resolution. Now.

13) Get some hobbies

14) If you have trouble doing some of these things, make a rigid agenda. 

15) NoFap. Don't knock it till you try it. 

I know some people would say this is all ""redpill advice"", but the way they pull you in pretty insidious. Overall I left for a couple of reasons. One was the recognition of the get rich quick scheme non-sense that I hated. It is, at minimum, going to take you at least a year for your life to be better. Anyone who says otherwise is selling you snake oil. Also I became deeply suspicious of a lot of the evo-psych nonsense. The only thing I still truly believe is the idea of hypergamy, but this should not be a point of hatred towards women like they make it out to be, not is it nearly as extreme as they make it out to be. But the idea that women trade up is true, but I don't see this as a bad thing, it's their biology, they would want theoretical good genes. 

Their hyper-focus on having sex and getting sex is also quite destructive. I remember a post on nofap that talked about how PUA culture had a huge flaw on it's major over-emphasis for sex above everything else. I tend to agree with that and I think it can be extended to all of theredpill. Such an intense focus actually puts sex and women on a pedestal. It's ironic, for all their claims of taking women off the pedestal, they simply put her on a different and equally high(if not higher pedestal). Putting the pussy on the pedestal is what they do EVERY SINGLE DAY and with each passing ""field report"" sex goes a little bit higher. The reality of the game is that they are just as powerless as they ever were in terms of getting sex, they just talk to far more women, increasing their odds. So basically it's all probability. So much for game theory. 

I did some serious introspection in my life as well and recognized I was just swinging from one extreme to the next. I didn't want to be an extremist anymore. I don't care much for politics or news anymore. I'm not an idiot, I just don't need to get worried about things I can't change. I need to live my life while I can. Thankfully my redpill experience only lasted 8 months, and I'm recently ex-redpill with a few more years of college to go. I'm hoping to make them great. 

There's one more things I want to go more in-depth about and it's marketing. Marketing is a powerful tool by which people are able to make you buy products. But in a social sense, to make you believe their ideology. Their marketing is very effective and getting two types of men, myself(you can see my characteristics in the first paragraph) and divorced guys. They clearly pick guys who already have a disposition to not like women. Now before everyone start's screaming, ""see it's misogyny"". I would respond that these people(namely women and a good deal of men) have no idea what it is like to be alone for years and years.

cks03u1,"&gt Isn't it feminist Hanna Rosin who showed that pay gap is actually something like 91 cents to a dollar now?

I honestly don't know - searching the web I cannot find any paper by her in the field of economics. There is a 2005 study by June O'Neil of the Congressional Budget Office showing a 92 % disparity between men and women - and no statistically significant disparity between *childless* men a and women. This supports the research by Shelley Correll of Stanford which showed that parenthood impacted men positively and women negatively in terms of likelyhood of promotion, starting salary, and similar variables. Interestingly, there is very, *very* little difference between the earnings of childless men and women with children, suggesting that most of the gap can be explained by positive discrimination towards men with children.

There is a 2007 study by CONSAD showing no disparity of statistical significance. This was accomplished by hypothesizing that a greater percentage of women than men tend to leave the labor force for child birth, child 
care and elder care - I do not know from where they got *those* numbers, but that is also a possible explanation for the discrepancy observed by O'Neil.

cks34ee,"&gt Feminism, is and always has been the struggle for equality between the sexes. 

That's true if radical feminism doesn't count as feminism.  Some writers explicitly state, ""we do not want women to merely have equality with men, we want to smash the kyriarchal capitalist system!""

I really wish I could believe you.  I've read too many Jezebel articles for that to be possible.  There are people I wholeheartedly agree with, such as Wendy McElroy, but most modern feminism is what McElroy refers to as ""gender feminism""--radfems, intersectional white-haters, Jessica Valenti, Anita Sarkeesian, everyone else who sees patriarchy everywhere but where it actually is--which means that most self-identified feminist groups who are ideological tend to be assholes who ruin fun.

You know what the far right does with people they don't like?  They post their personal info to RedWatch and wait for the dissenters' lives to be ruined.  I cannot sympathize with people who act no better. People who fantasize about punishing Reddit users for saying something online that hurt a woman's fee-fees.  People who fantasize about punishment and censorship.

I identify as libertarian because I tend to agree with what John Stossel, Milton Friedman, the LP, etc. say.  When I read something ""feminist,"" I usually disagree with it.  What the fuck would you have me do?  The only damn reason to call myself feminist now is to kowtow to what's considered ""good"" despite my gut feelings.

Sure, I agree with McElroy and Sommers.  I also agree with the rationalist fringe of Islam and Christianity, which by most standards would be a sign of atheism, not a sign of religiousness.

Growing up in the Bible Belt, where birth control, prostitution and abortion are proscribed by an irrational government, I *loved* Jessica Valenti's *The Virginity Myth.*  I bought that shit with my own money, and I still have it on my bookshelf to this day.  I wish feminists were talking about mullahs and the religious right instead of talking about gamers, Redditors and white atheist STEM nerds.  Yes, I like porn, just as you Jezebel editors like to take creepshots of DILFs.  I do not owe the world a damn thing just because I'm white and don't get harassed by the cops as much.  I do not believe in censorship or big government.  But I am not your fucking enemy.  

A feminist Reddit, by all appearances, would be just like church: no naughty words, no talking bad about the sacred things like /r/racism, no ""shitty opinions"" (i.e., opinions that contradict dogma).   I just got banned by TrollXChromosomes, a sub I used to like until the Tumblr post about *To Catch a Redditor* ended up at the top of the page.  I can't stand /r/TheBluePill for even five minutes.  I see no reason to stay on reddit if TiA, porn subs, /r/walmart, etc. ends up in the same situation.

**TLDR** I didn't choose to bash feminism.  The most vocal, influential parts of feminism chose to bash me, because god knows what goes on in the alien brain of a SRS mod, much less the adminship who (generally, but not always [they shadowbanned an /r/blackladies mod, thank god](https://i.imgur.com/znscaF8.jpg)) gives them free reign while everyone else is kept on a tight leash.

The ""Alpha"" persona that they use is just that: a character that they portray in order to summon reactions from the people around them.

So messages like ""teach men not to rape"" is well respected by men who are *already* feminists, but useless to men who aren't and so it accomplishes very little. Hounding men out of employment for not expressing feminist approved morals is a simple act of political revenge which is fine so long as you recognize it as such. Same with the recent targeting of the gaming industry. In the end I view the movement as on the ascent in the social and cultural world. Any political movement that gains power will rally it's base by enacting vengeance upon enemy demographics in this case loser ""beta"" males. TRP catches these guys when they fall.

I'm a politically radical minority, and I see similar forces at work among my peers with regards to their relationship with white allies. A lot of radical minorities will spend a lot of time and energy criticizing well meaning but misguided white allies, and very little time working on things that actually matter.

I personally treat the women in my life with full respect. My wife and I are raising our daughter as a *person first* and do everything in our power to not sexualize her or encourage her behavior one way or another as far as gender goes.

1: The racism and conspiracy theories infesting it. I'm a non-white man: Even if I hated women as much as TRPers do, I'd want nothing to do with the racism, anti-semitism, and other assorted nonsense that infects their ideology. And as I started to think, if those guys are wrong about blacks and Jews, they're probably wrong about a bunch of other stuff too.

2: The incoherence of their ideology. They talk a lot about how women want ""fried ice,"" but what red-pillers want is even less clear.

Honestly, I'd expect you're torn between the obvious sociopathy of TRP, vs the more convoluted sociopathy of feminism that puts a nice candy coating over it's sociopathy.

One finds themselves drawn to feminism because it hits that sympathetic part of the brain that's associated with femininity, compassion, and feelings. Then it traps you into a feeling that the **only** way you're allowed to feel that way is if you agree with them.

So far you've mostly just used manipulative claims to assert that somehow TRP is ISIS, that TRP will try to kill you, and made accussations of ""damage"" that as far as I can tell have no existence in reality.

Frankly, at most I'd quote one of the people from above:
&gt Honestly, I find contemporary feminism and TRP to be quite similar philosophies, if opposite in direction and scale. Both are systems made up of logically sound arguments springing from populism, baseless assumptions, and outdated or flawed data.
&gt
&gt If your personal worldview is centered on the baseless assumption that men and only men are capable of unselfish love, large parts of TRP becomes justified. Similarly, if you subscribe to the equally baseless doctrine that a 77-100 wage gap exists, large parts of the more vitriolic, Dworkin-esque feminism becomes justified.
&gt
&gt Similarly structured systems, different ideologies. While both might contain grains (or straws full of grain, in the case of feminism) of truth, I cannot in good faith subscribe to either.

Aaaaaaaahahahahahahahahahaha. Giving them too much credit, aren't we? One of the core red pill philosophies is that women (and, assumedly, manginas) are incompetent, helpless invalids incapable of opening a jar of pickles by themselves, much less less carrying out the nightmarishly effective terror and repression Stalin was known for. They'll never be a real threat to me--at least if you guys are right.

In any case, I'd take the labor camp anyways. If I get shot in the street, I'd just be dead. I'd have a chance of survival in the gulag, or at least fomenting a rebellion among my fellow prisoners before going out.

Just after the Civil War, one could argue that the only thing the Klan did was dress up in funny robes. You freaks may not be doing anything *now,* but the potential harm you could do outweighs, by many orders of magnitude, the worst the feminists could ever possibly do. As much as false rape accusations right now may suck, I'll take them over even the possibility of death camps in the future.

But oh, yes, getting sent to jail is every bit as bad as being dead. Life really is cheap to you guys, isn't it? I wonder if you'd embrace feminism if they advocated just killing the male population straight-out rather than slowly ""reducing"" us over time.

&gtAnd if feminists got their way, your lawyer would do as much good for you as they did for political prisoners in Stalin-era Russia. In other words, no good at all.

Well, that's the nice thing about the good stuff from Mossberg: It can tear through loony lefties and righties alike. If feminism ever proves itself to be as fruitlessly genocidal as TRPish philosophies have in the past--and if feminism's bad because the Commies (assumedly) liked it, I hope you're willing to kick all the atheists out of TRP, and there are a shitload of 'em--then rest assured, I'll view them the same way I view you. Until that time comes, however, I'll sneer at feminism and aim at TRP.

&gtHonestly, I'd expect you're torn between the obvious sociopathy of TRP, vs the more convoluted sociopathy of feminism that puts a nice candy coating over it's sociopathy.

I'm not. I'm merely judging the ideologies by their effects in the real world. After decades of bitching about men, feminists have turned the US into a country where...I can sit in my room and fap to porn, listen to music, play videogames, or do whatever the hell I want without needing a woman.

The biological differences in men and women were most noticed during hunter gathering times as well. Men were stronger and women had better color sense which led to them picking non poisonous plants and berries.

cl45nw1,"Welcome, friend. Glad to see another brother moving away from ""Red Pill"" dogma and silliness. To respond to your points:

Male Disposability: Remember that A: Mostly male politicians start these wars, and B: in modern warfare being female isn't a sure way not to get killed. Thanks to mass bombing and things like that, it's not as ""safe"" to be a woman as it used to be.

That said, anyone who really wants to end male disposability would do well to work towards a more peaceful world, which is exactly what RPers *don't* want.

Divorce: Yeah, that sucks, but the solution to that is to not get married. I think a lot of our divorce and alimony laws are archaic holdbacks to a bygone era that will change as time goes on, but until it does, there's nothing wrong with not getting married. Where TRP jumps off the rails is when they claim it's a ""feminist conspiracy"" as opposed to the slow rate of social change.

Sleeping Around: it's not something I care about myself, but I can understand if some guys do. My advice? If sexual experience is important, hire an escort. I'm not saying this to be flippant, I really mean it--if you haven't had much sex, as you say you haven't, just getting it out of the way will teach you it's not such a big deal, one way or the other, so you won't feel as angry towards women who have a lot of it.

Gold-Digging: Again, TRP's right when they say it sucks, they're wrong when they start talking about hypergamy as some previously unknown evil that controls the world via the ""feminine imperative."" Women like rich guys? Gee, no fucking shit, feminism sure obscured that earth-shattering truth. Anyways, if the local girls are too materialistic, I advise working to get some money yourself--it'll be easier, ironically enough, to find women who don't care as much about money when you've got it. Finding a good career is advisable for reasons beyond getting chicks, because with more money you'll have a lot more freedom, like being able to travel or buy cool stuff that you like, allowing you to meet different girls. It's also a lot of hard work, though. You could also try to work on your physical appearance rather than your career, ""Hypergamy"" applies to looks as well as wealth, after all, so a ripped but poor guy might be able to do as well as an average looking but wealthy guy. This also has the benefit of bettering your health, too.

cl4byht,"Hi friend! I'm going to try to hit some alternative points. 

Male disposability: the flip side is being seen as so weak or incompetent that you aren't even allowed to fight if you want to. The two major pushes for women being on the front lines have been BY WOMEN and were rejected by male politicians. (Just google, you will see that the vast majority of pushes for women in the army have been by women's rights groups and by female politicians.) What we can't ignore is that *most* women don't have the physical capacity to be on the front lines. It's not a matter of disposability, but rather physical suitability. Some women are suitable and others aren't. Should all women be barred because the majority aren't as strong as men? Absolutely not. But that's a huge block that is in the way of women being accepted on the front lines of war. Women are seen and thought of as weaker, not necessarily more precious.  As for the draft, I believe it's awful and shouldn't exist anyway. If both sexes were in the draft, who would work at home? During wars, women have historically taken over stereotypically male jobs to make up for the lack of men at home. Additionally, they were the ones home to raise children. We would need to figure out how to address those issues (retaining staff for critical infrastructure and having parents) before we could enlist everyone in the draft. 

Divorce and child custody: please look at actual statistics from trustworthy sources. I'm on mobile right now, but if you look, child custody is almost 50/50 WHEN the dad chooses to fight for primary custody. Most don't. Also remember that you're not going to hear about all the amicable divorces you are only going to hear about the horror stories. And because of *your sources* of information, you're only going to hear the man's side. Women have been screwed in divorce. Additionally, a lot of these people have no understanding of how courts decide to give alimony. If you think about it, it's not fair for a red pill man to expect his wife to stay home, sacrificing all her best career-growth years, then they get divorced because she's sick of his abuse and manipulation and stuck working as a grocery clerk part-time because she has no relevant experience for the last 15 years. Get a reasonable pre-nup, and understand what is at stake if you ask her to stop working.  ",p_iynx,10,t3_2ioslo,2014-10-08 22:12:24
cl4ekit,"Hi. I really appreciate seeing these questions. Here are some of my opinions: 

1. Male disposability. Ouch. It hurt me to even see these two words put together. Now, since I'm from America, I was probably just raised to see all of this differently. But I still think it's safe to say that feminism has been one of the causes of the men-to-women ratio of our military slowly becoming more even. In fact, the year after my father graduated from the Air Force Academy in the 70s was the first year when women were admitted to that school. Speaking of my father, I know as a citizen and as a person with military family members that *men are not disposable. In fact, my somewhat liberal opinion is that NO PERSON is disposable.* I don't think the average person, meaning the people who have to fight the wars rather than the people who start them, thinks of other fighters as being disposable. Even my father, who joined the Air Force just before the Vietnam war ended and was fully expecting to be drafted anyway, and has said many times that he would personally be willing to sacrifice himself if the need arose, *always reminds me that NO ONE should EVER, EVER be obligated to sacrifice him or herself.* It must be an individual's choice. As we move forward in the future, I hope all governments and nations can come to realize this.

2. Divorce. The gold-digging ex-wife is a stereotype perpetuated by the fact that most husbands still earn much more money than their wives do, which is something else feminism can help put to a stop. The logic behind it is the woman has usually made choices (such as quitting a job or working less) to devote more of her time to the marriage/children in effect she had made choices damaging her financial independence for the sake of her husband, and then at the divorce is asking for recompense. If you are worried about losing money in a divorce, there are pre-nuptial agreements (prenups) to prevent that from happening. Or, even better, don't get married to a person you do not trust entirely.

3. Sleeping around. Where I'm from, men get bragging rights for having slept around whereas women with lots of sexual experience are usually labeled sluts. In fact, being an inhabitant of the conservative Midwest, it's much more common for women to encourage each other to ""wait"" for marriage than for men. Whatever you are hearing about every women your age getting laid every night is simply untrue. Also, the female sexual prime (age 30ish) happens later than the male sexual prime (20ish). I've heard female libido peaks around age 30-35, so assuming you wish to date women your age, you're just in time for the fun. Also, I think you should question why you find this to be ""unjust toward [your]self."" If the love of your life has not met you yet, how can you blame her for having a different boyfriend now? Would you expect the girl you meet 5 years from now to resent you for the girlfriend you sleep with next year? That doesn't make any sense. Besides, people who have had sex before almost always make better, less awkward lovers than those who haven't. If you start a relationship with a woman who already has a good idea of how to please you, rejoice! You're lucky!

4. Gold-digging. Eh... I don't know what I can say about this, since I like to think I am one of those Westerners who can have a healthy and mutually productive relationship. Since I am not familiar with the actual reality of your social surroundings, I don't know how to help, sorry.",eggwig,26,t3_2ioslo,2014-10-08 23:47:06

cl528hk,"Disclaimer: 27/f, feminist, American, works full-time, long-term relationship with a man leading to marriage.

**Regarding male ""disposability""**: this is something that I've seen come up a lot recently and I'm honestly very concerned about.  While we've seen a lot of movement for women towards accepting themselves and breaking out of gender roles, there hasn't been any equivalent accepting of men doing the same.  In order to achieve the equality and justice we need, we truly need to get on providing the acceptance of men that want to step out of the traditional gender roles that currently make manymen feel like their only purpose is to work and provide for a woman and children or die in a war.  **Men have just as much right to feel respected, and worthy, and empowered as women.**

One thing that most or all feminists have in common is that we *completely support the dismantling and abolishment of selective service*.  Female politicians especially tend to be against war.

**Divorce**.   I'm going to go ahead and tell you, yeah, this isn't fair, but it's becoming moreso.  A lot of divorce laws and current practices in divorce court are based on laws and practices put into place in order to protect women who couldn't work or, if working, could not approximate the kind of income needed to support herself and her children if she was granted custody.  that's something that absolutely needs to be changed.  I have heard, now, of women having to pay alimony to husbands whose income potential is lower.  Honestly, now that women are working and making their own money, any alimony/child support should be entirely concerned with balancing the children's standard of living.

**Sleeping around**.  This is a tricky one for guys with a lot less experience than prospective female partners because you feel like women don't want you for who you are and who you want to be -- an attractive partner, a sexually viable man, instead of a potential provider for her and her future children.  That's understandable but is unfortunately perpetuated by this RP idea that, while only men are supposed to ""spin plates"" until they settle down, women can't do the same.  I don't see a problem.  People want to have kind of crazy sex with people they'd NEVER settle down with in their younger years, but I don't know a single person (women included) who's looking to settle down with someone more stable that they don't find personally and sexually attractive, too.  What it comes down to is this: pick a partner you love and trust.  I slept with a ton of people in college and right out, and I still have crazy awesome sex with my partner, but he is 100% more sexually attractive to me BECAUSE he is the kind of guy I'd spend the rest of my life with.  People change over the course of their lives -- men and women alike.  What TRP call ""spinning plates"" for men is ""riding the cock carousel"" for women.  Why don't they understand that they're talking about *exactly the same thing*?

**Gold digging.**  Do women make as much money as men where you live?  Can they support themselves, or are they dependent upon their fathers, boyfriends or husbands for support?  If they're dependent, I'm not surprised they're trying to trade up.  The best way to make sure women won't try to gold-dig their way to the top of the food chain is to a) make sure they have access to employment that pays as well as men's, and b) make sure you, yourself, don't date shallow people.",littlelibertine,12,t3_2ioslo,2014-10-09 17:50:11

The only problem is you can do those things without taking TRP and all the baggage that comes with it (unless you truly believe that a woman's worth is directly tied to her sexual partners/think they are pure evil - in which case you can stop reading my post now).

So, what is the premise for being part of the red pill community? To avoid becoming like the dudes whom pedestalize women and worship them? To move away from blaming an external force and to take responsibility for one's physical appearance and social skills?

Great. Except, from my perspective, a large majority of them have just again fallen into a pattern of blame via hatred of women and very misogynistic attitudes.

And this is the problem. They are insistent that women play a game, some of the more extreme types go so far as to believe that women intentionally marry men so they can divorce them later for all their assets. I'm not saying that hasn't happened or doesn't happen, but really? This shows how little they've actually interacted with women in some humanistic way.

I think this is the important part: the way they treat women will FOREVER deter the kind of woman they are apparently looking for: one that isn't emotionally 19, one that doesn't ""play games"", one that won't engage in ""divorce rape"", etc. 

It's like TRP is the male version of Cosmopolitan for women - it works on a few random dudes but it's likely going to perpetuate your purpose for being there.

Of course, I need not mention the men that believe women are inherently evil, that no woman can mature beyond teenage years, that a woman is not a person with *gasp* the same possible interests as men, that all women are seeking to take advantage of them via divorce, that a woman is not a human in the same way and her value is directly tied to her sexual partner count, etc.

People that believe that regressive nonsense will always exist - and of course TRP philosophy will attract those types due to its very nature.

I feel like TRP is a different side of the same coin as TBP - they both engage in this fantasy world regarding women and it becomes a whole lot speculation, anecdotal evidence, bias, and blaming women for their problems.

How do men get along with other men? I would assume they keep the guys they like around and ditch the douchebags. Yeah, maybe it gets complicated when one's aim is to just stick a dick in the other person, but maybe if men treated women as other *people* they'd have a much easier time finding someone compatible and reduce attracting the same game-playing ""whores"" that they claim to have so much disdain for.

cl5u6h2,"Male disposability: Historically, political offices were only open to men so, like Gunlord said, it was mostly male politicians starting wars and male politicians also didn't allow women to fight in wars. In fact, women weren't allowed to fight in the front lines, until recently. I'm sure that women would've gone to war if it was allowed, because even during the Civil War and World Wars, some women worked as spies or dressed up as men and snuck into the army. As a woman a western country, I find it unfair that only males have to fill out a draft card when they turn 18, in my country.    

Divorce: There's the option of a prenup. In some cases, women choose to be homemakers while their husbands work and provide all the family income, so of course your wife would get alimony because if you're the one making all the money and house(s) and car(s) are under your name, then she'd need the money to at least travel back to her parents' house or get her own place. Another circumstance is that sometimes the husband chooses to pack up his stuff, move out, and abandon the wife and kids, so, because she now has to raise the kids on her own and has full custody of them, due to his choices, he has to pay child support because he should take some responsibility in taking care of his kids, even if it's just sending a check every month.    

Sleeping around: I'd take into account the context of their experience as well. What if they did sleep with 10 people, but were in exclusive relationships with all those people and were mutually in love with all of them? Maybe that's just a normal part of relationships for them. I think it's ok to have that standard of not wanting to date someone who has a lot more experience than you, as long as you still respect them as people and don't see them as lower than you or other people who have less experience. There are some people who won't have sex unless their married to that person, so it would make things much easier if they dated someone with the same values, and someone who has those values likely wouldn't have much sexual experience, as well.    

Gold digging: The RP consensus seems to be that women should put their bf/husband and marriage and kids first and that they should cater to their husband's needs, be docile, and admire him, whereas they believe men should provide and protect for their gf/wife and kids. The RP idea places the financial burden on the man. I prefer an egalitarian relationship, because I think the onus of providing and protecting should be on both parties, as well as the onus of putting your partner's needs first and making them feel respected and admired.

cl8oob7,"Hello. Woman here. I'm an egalitarianist, and I consider myself a feminist and long as it means equal oportunities for *both genders*. This means fighting for men's rights also. I've been telling people I'm a feminist because I want people to stop thinking that feminism means male hating. I hate misandry as much as I hate misogyny.

But since the word ""feminism"" brings up so much confusion, I'm considering dropping it and just use egalitarianism instead.

That said:

- **Male disposability**. You're right, that is a big one. That ""be a man"" attitude is as wrong as telling a woman to just smile and be pretty. It's hard to be yourself when people keep telling you what you should be, and that goes both ways. Being sensitive and in touch with yourself doesn't mean you're less manly, if anything it means you're more confident.

- **Divorce** Maybe I don't know what stories you're referring to, but don't you feel that this could apply to women too? I mean, both men and women can inherit a fortune, and if both genders work and make money, there's less chance of people wanting to marry for money. Marrying someone for money is not cool ^-unless ^that ^someone ^is ^aware ^of ^it ^and ^doesn't ^mind. ^In ^that ^case, ^that's ^just ^a ^bit ^weird ^for ^me-, I don't understand why people do it and couldn't consider it myself, but then again I don't need to. Maybe if I lived in a very patriarcal country and couldn't get a job, I would have to.

- **Sleeping around** I don't like thinking that my boyfriend has been with a lot of girls before me, but that's just how it is. I lost my V card late and with a guy that had slept around a lot (it wasn't just a one time thing, though). I too was concerned a bit bothered by that, but in the end it just didn't matter. I can't compare myself to other people and have my own experiences to live. I can understand why the reverse situation might be a bit worse (men with less experience than a woman), but that is social pressure and isn't a real rule. A lot of women may actually find it interesting to be with a less experienced person, and a woman who likes you may just not care about that. I don't think people actually think about that too much.

- **Gold-digging** /u/littlelibertine makes a good point about this.

I'd like to add that I think that one of the reasons we don't hear as much about these concerns as we hear about women's rights is because these are often accompanied with hate and an already extreme attitude, and so they're dismissed for being over-the-top and not very reasonable.
I said ""one of the reasons"" because the main reason is probably because people just answer ""OH BUT WOMEN HAVE IT SO MUCH WORSE."" and ""STOP COMPLAINING, YOU EFFING MISOGYNYST"".",apopo-popo,1,t3_2ioslo,2014-10-13 20:53:05

clbb10t,"An an ex-RP, do you ever feel a little sad that you were even an RP to begin with? Or do you just figure, ""Well, that was some bullshit I apparently needed to go through""?

I think men just go through some bad shit, sometimes a lot of it, before they finally end up on the right page. I've never committed rape, but I've probably haunted some women by being obsessed or jealous in middle school, high school, and college.

I used to think [Chris Rock's comedy was Red Pill gold](http://redd.it/2ih1ot). Then it became a little less funny. Then I think goddamn I'm glad I'm not Chris Rock, because if I was I'd feel a little weird and guilty about broadcasting my inner bullshit. He's on the wrong life-page. Especially his last HBO special when he's talking about how he's married and how his wife still says shit he doesn't understand and sounds goofy as fuck to him - where he's like, ""If you want to help me woman, introduce me to a girl!"" Some of that shit is only really funny if you suspend disbelief and go back to your old paradigms and mindset that wasn't working for you.

It's like how some men actually kind of pride themselves for being a ""loser"" - like it's cool to be some kind of lost failure that doesn't understand shit and never will.

Hell I still love the shit out of Batman, but Batman is weird. He's touted as guy obsessed about sticking to some high end, puritanical moral code and either he's some kind of super monk or he just doesn't get chicks. But if he applied even half of his CIA/FBI super sleuthing abilities toward women, he'd understand women so well he'd be more like James Bond where he couldn't go more than 3 feet without his dick getting caught in a hot pussy.

Pardon my digressions, but do you think men just kind of don't get on the right page or take a long ass time getting on the right page? I'm 41 and I'm just *now* getting some traction.

clbe2od,"I've never been a redpiller. I was into the seduction community for a while, and I think I did lean a lot about social psychology in general and what is attractive.  Redpill adds nothing to ""seduction,"" except misogyny and fedora-level euphoria backed up with pseudo science. Before red pill, the seduction community itself had its own misogynists that probably splintered off, believing they discovered some secret. I subscribed to seduction because I wondered why I couldn't replicate success in getting hot girls. I realized I was relying on timing rather than just going after it. That and I'm attractive, which I believe is vastly more important than anything else.

I think there is a reason that so many men are so bad with women that they need to resort to manipulation or tearing down an entire gender to make them feel better about their shortcomings. It probably has to do a lot with socially constructed ideas of gender (a man does X, a woman does Y) at a young age, combined with media portrayal of the relationship between men and women (women hold the power, men only want sex, etc). This, and people are so fucking stubborn and egotistical that they would rather blame women than evaluate themselves.

Once you enter the right zone in your own mind you don't have a whole lot to worry about and the chips just start falling into place. It suddenly becomes about communication and interactivity. Like once you're on a date, your personality, looks, confidence, and social proof are what they are. And during the date you can always do something stupid, have a booger hanging out of your nose, be afraid of spiders, and be in a situation where nobody's vouching for you.

The only difference is now they are victimizing themselves rather than being victimized by their original abusers. This is the definition of a term called revictimisation. There is no coercion. There is willful consent and decisions being made. But these decisions still come from an incredibly dark place in life. When people like yourself say they are okay with the sex trade so long as nobody is being forced Either they do not understand what revictimisation is, or they simply don't care.

No, Red Pill ideology as short as possible is a bunch of half-baked ""evolutionary psychology"" ideas about how women are useless and good for absolutely nothing except sex, yet somehow manage to ""oppress"" the other 50% of the population which is superior to them in every respect. Now, there may be a few kernels of decent advice buried under all that nonsense--women aren't attracted to unattractive guys, women aren't goddesses, and marriage sucks these days. The problem is, I can get all of that advice, easily (most of it is completely self evident--women are attracted to attractive men?

clmjg6i,"I cannot of course speak for all women (generalizations being what they are) but I can speculate that yes, at the very least, *most* women are afraid to be raped. As a survivor of rape, allow me to elaborate on why:

- it is the single most violating thing another person can do to you - to assert their own will over your bodily autonomy in spite of your protests or inability to consent. 

- in most cases, we're aware that our rapist will be someone we know, someone we thought we could trust, someone we felt safe with.

- in many cases, if we report the crime we will be asked humiliating and irrelevant questions by the police, the defense attorney, possibly the press. In the most media-covered cases, our rape (a crime committed upon our person) will be a topic of household and online debate. 

- In some cases, you may become pregnant (I did). You may then be faced with the choice of what to do about the foetus. It was easy for me, to decide to terminate the pregnancy. However, being 14 years old and walking through the crowd of protesters around the clinic who called me a whore and a murderer was much more traumatic. Being treated like the scum of the earth by the doctor who performed the termination was icing on the cake. Similarly, the assertion by: my parents, my grandparents, and the police that I was ""crying rape"" to ""get out of"" being pregnant was an additional trauma of that experience.

- You never forget. It never goes away. It may damage your ability to deal with men at all. You may develop PTSD. Your personal relationships will suffer.

- People on the internet like your RP comrades will then discuss how you probably just changed your mind afterward, how the criminal who assaulted us is *really* the victim, and how in certain cases consent either doesn't exist or doesn't matter.",plentyofrabbits,43,t3_2kj83t,2014-10-28 19:24:54

There are women out there who don't buy into the cosmo bullshit, who are not ""hypergamous"", who are sexually compatible with you, etc..

clq1cyo,"I see a lot of red-pillers as people who just haven't expanded their social radius enough to meet people (specifically women, but males friends play a big role too) they vibe with well. 


Have you ever moved out of your hometown because you had other pursuits in life, only to return one day and see it a little differently? You feel like you don't have much in common with your old friends that stayed and never left, you see people that are unhappy because they never made that decision to leave their cookie-cutter suburb? That's kind of what red-pillers are like. 


Red-pillers stayed in these toxic social environments and never learned to just meet people who they see eye to eye with (women and men alike) and maybe feel low self-esteem around them because of it. So they develop these strategies for social interactions where they're the ""big man"" or the ""winner"" by manipulating others. Why even go through all that trouble when you can just be your true confident self and surround yourself socially with non-manipulative shitty people? Why would you want to win those people over or prove yourself to them? It seems like a big waste of time and an unnecessary headache. 


One thing I like about TRP is the people in the group who focus on self-improvement and see sex/relationships as a byproduct of that self-improvement. But this is usually buried underneath the ""This hot girl at college I really like is a slut, how can I make her feel like shit about herself so I can get her to sleep with me?"" A lot of the women I know who have great personalities wouldn't spend 2 more seconds around a guy who belittles them or uses ""dread game"".. 


What pushed me away from TRP was ultimately the misogyny and regressive-conservatism of it. One poster told me that I ""look weak"" for hanging out with female friends at a bar. If you can't make friends with a woman, how the hell do you expect to have a relationship with one? Also ideas that women can't have male friends is setting yourself up for the jealousy and anger issues that a 16 year old displays with their first girlfriend. 


Ultimately, I think the red pill is a product of a bunch of guys who weren't quite there sexually and socially who became frustrated and bitter.. I don't think that a lot of them really know what they're talking about and they just idolize ""olde time"" 50's-esque manly things and wish it were that way today (as if that would do any good for someone who spends a good portion of their day in solitude whining on the internet about how they can't get a date.)

And it is enlightening to point out the way women receive lots of special treatment, just like men do. It's just different types of treatment. If all you do is talk about the one side, you give the impression you don't know about the other side, or that the other side doesn't even have it bad. Comparing is useless. How am I supposed to compare the fact that I will earn $0.10 per dollar more than you to the fact that you have the extremely acceptable option of having your life paid for by a man if you wanted? Or how can I compare that I can feel safer than you walking the streets at night but you have a lesser likelihood than me of actually being the victim of violent crime? It can't and shouldn't be done. Let's deal with those issues separately. Modern feminism wants to half-ass the men's issues, though, and that I will never be able to get behind. They take every direct approach they can with women's issues, but claim to be trying to fix men's issues by fixing step A over here and claiming this will affect the man's issue at step N all the way over there. Not buying it.

I went through several months of a dry spell with a lot of self loathing. Then all of a sudden, I'm in this zen state. I'm busy with my career, seeing multiple women casually who seem to get that, and not really caring if things dry up again, as long as they don't crash and burn messily. I'm honest, no game, and no tricks. I can't handle relationships for my own personal reasons, so I've resigned myself to bachelorhood. And for now, that makes me very, very happy.

Since I'm no longer looking for or valuing LTRs, I'm liberated. I love ""sluts."" Literally, I allow myself to fall in love with easy girls for like a week, then it fades. Then I see them again and repeat. It's beautiful. And if they were to disappear I would be disappointed...for about a week.

cltrsi6,"I've spent a lot of time over the years in redpill circles. There is a lot of very useful pragmatic advice to be found, but as others have said its often wrapped up in a toxic culture. Unfortunately there is rarely any equivalent advice that is politically correct or acceptable to talk about outside of those circles.

Unfortunately spending time in the redpill culture has its own disadvantages, both to wellbeing and outside judgment. Much of the advice is sound, but its amoral. By that I mean that the techniques don't have a moral value in and of themselves, but only through their application. They need to be selectively applied according to your own code of ethics. 

To put this in perspective there are many things that women can do to make themselves attractive to men. These things are also amoral and you can see different girls using their attractiveness in different ways according to their ethics (milking free stuff from men vs acting as wingwoman for a guy out at a bar). Away from a toxic culture many of these techniques for women don't attract any attention in and of themselves.

For me personally there are a lot of things that I apply from past learnings, but I definitely focus on being genuine and to a degree being vulnerable.
