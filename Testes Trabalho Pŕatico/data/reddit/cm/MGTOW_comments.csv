-  ""... General intelligence is significantly more variable in men, but the average difference between the sexes is close to zero. As a result, men end up being over-represented at both the high and low end of the intelligence distribution the same pattern is found in measures of academic performance (e.g., Arden and Plomin, 2006Johnson et al., 2008Lehre et al., 2009).

e2pgxqc,"&gtWe've been seeing each other for almost two years now.

I've been fucking her for almost two years now.

&gtI was always clear that this was going to be a temporary thing - that I cannot see myself long term with a late thirties single mom with 2 kids.

I know she's going to become a wrinkly dry hot pocket in no time flat and I cannot see myself eating a wrinkly dry hot pocket for the rest of my life.

&gtI am in my late twenties and have a strong desire for my own kids - if I could somehow have kids without the hassle of a woman, I'd totally go for it.

Artificial womb isn't available yet (AFAIK). Have your sperm checked for its health, and if its fine, then you have the rest of your life to become a father.

&gtShe has 'broken up' with me thrice because I wont commit to her 100% - but we always fucking get back. It feels fantastic in the moment but I know this is just a ticking time bomb.

&gtShe is easily an 8/9 and has Orbiters circling her all the time, has a great job and is overall in a good place in her life.

She really wants you to pay *alimony* and she knows she almost got you, once she finally ties you down she won't have to work anymore.

&gtI have no need to 'protect' her but my posture has always been that of a watchful protector male who takes care of her - blame culture, male psychology, evolution..its irrelevant why its there.

Mixed signals from a white knight?

&gtI told her several times we need to end this, but we just don't talk about the serious stuff anymore - its like she has made her peace with my half ass commitment and wants to live out few more months/years/life/whatever.

She is finally convinced that he's weak and is brainwashed enough to enter her plantation.

&gtI have this strong desire to not hurt her and plan to wait until she initiates a fourth breakup. I caved in and initiated conversations after the last three and we just ended up back together. The comfort and warmth of a momentary reunion makes me zone out the big picture. I fucking fall for it every single time.

I really don't want to tug this nice hot pocket back and forth. What if one day she decides she doesn't my hot dog in her pocket anymore?

&gtIn an ideal world, I would just fucking man up, end it and walk away, but I have feelings for her and want the separation to be 'graceful'.

In an ideal world I would just rent a hot pocket, and pay her to go away, but my hot dog has strong urges when I see her and want a backdoor just in case I need to release my urges in her.

&gtI dont hate her - I just dont think we are in the right time and space to be with each other. All I want to do is breakup with her, get on my bike and drive away, but I dont do it.

She's not a bad hot pocket, I just don't think we are meant to become a pig in a blanket. All I want to do is realize that she's just a hot pocket, get on my crotch rocket and ride away, but my urges are too strong.

&gtGuys who've been here before, what do I do? where does this road end?

Positively have not been there before. You should not enter the plantation. That road ends in a plantation.

&gtrecent mgtow

Ehhh, I would say you only have one foot in the MGTOW, but it's better than being chained to the plantation on any day.

If you managed to read all the way down here... On a more serious note:

Fapoff, fapoff again, if you're not drained yet fapoff until you are.

Now that your mind is *clearer*, write down a list with an actual pen and paper the pros and cons of this *relationship*, without using any euphemism/PC language.

e2ph1q0,"&gtAfter some soul searching I realized that I am a horrific judge of character, I try to see the best in people - this sets me up to get burned. It's just part of who I am.

&gtI don't hate women, I just know for certain that I would get fooled and taken to the cleaners by one because of the type of person I am.

A couple of things relevant to the **present** state of such things (versus say the ""historical"" one, i.e. a century or more ago). It **used to be** people were born into, raised within, and the vast majority STAYED &amp LIVED within a *local* community.

1. One aspect of that was that your ""character"" was known, and so was everyone else's (including potential ""spouses"").

2. Secondly, that ""community"" tended to help watch out for such ""matches"" -- both helping to facilitate ones where the people's character was a good match, and also probably inhibiting even throwing up cautions/warnings when they felt was a ""bad"" match.

3. Adding to that, the local ""community"" was also likely to have been a lot more ""uniform"" in it's worldview/beliefs -- that was the hidden ""blessing"" (and arguably THE main purpose) behind what is now called ""bigotry"" (racial, ethnic, religious) -- i.e. not just that people with a ""German"" ethnic heritage were expected to marry other ""Germans"" (and likewise Irish to marry Irish, Italians to marry Italians, Poles to marry Poles, etc) but one was expected to marry someone of the same ""faith/denomination""... it wasn't just that Germans married Germans, but German Catholics didn't marry German Lutherans, nor German Baptists, etc.  *That not only prevented a lot of ""conflicts"" -- especially divisiveness/arguments between spouses on ""how the children should be raised"" -- but it usually came with a whole host of OTHER (very practical) ""worldview"" things: related to not only the rearing of children, but financial practices (eschewing debt for example), and more.

-
In the present era -- in no small part due to MAJOR changes in ""transportation"" (cars &amp freeways, to say nothing of jet planes) &amp communications (first phones, then internet, now ubiquitous apps on ""smart phones"") -- the ""local community"" has effectively ceased to exist.

And of course the mindset if any LOYALTY to that -- is considered either ""backwards"" (ala Old Order Amish), or else ""bigotry"" -- people move about all over the place, have few (or no) ""ties"" to anyone (even family)... and so are ""FREE"" from all of those prior ""constraints.""

--
But of course... we're also BEREFT of the BENEFITS of the sort of ""filtering"" or ""vetting"" that such constraints (even call it ""bigotry"" if you want) produced -- and we are also, of course, ""free"" from the INHIBITING (controlling/shaming/shunning) aspect of it... which IMO is **also** as much of a LOSS, since it not only ""frees"" US up, it frees our friends/spouses up as well.

Instead of *order,* we have ""chaos.""  Instead of *stability,* we have ""uncertainty."" Instead of *loyalty, faithfulness, reliability,* we have a promiscuous ""free for all"" of immorality. (And not just ""sexual"" immorality, but the inherent immorality of ""blowing up a marriage"" -- depriving children of their father, depriving them of a stable family-- all to *attempt* to satisfy  the emotional ""feelings"" of w flighty female.)

--
Marriage has always been a BIT of a ""crapshoot"" -- but at least their were supporting ""structures"" in a society/community that helped to REDUCE the risk, etc -- NOW all of those things have been undermined, if not entirely ""swept away."" The result is that marriage is no longer JUST a ""crapshoot"" risk, it has become a ""fool's gambit"" one that is almost destined to fail for the majority of men (regardless of their perspicacity in judging others' character).",DWShimoda,1,t3_906f77,2018-07-20 01:16:38

If you deny a desire you experience its importance then you also decrease the desire. Once you deny importance you will stop thinking along these lines which lead to further pain and desire.

e2pj0bl,"I think there was a story on this group a while back that some women were filming guys coming up to talk to them at bars, just average guys, so that the women could post the videos online and make fun of them online.

All that stuff is, is just wickedness.  I'll see posts on this group where a guy is really upset, and I'll think he went too negative with his post, but you know what?  From the types of stories that we see on this group, you have to wonder if something really bad was done to at least some of those guys, to make them so negative.

But what about a woman who makes fun of random guys that she doesn't know, because she thinks they are unattractive?  What reason does she have to treat a guy, whom she doesn't even know, that way?  Those guys are just trying to meet women -- that used to be considered normal, I guess.  Those women are blaming those guys for just doing what society tells them that normal guys do -- trying to date women.

As far as how large those groups are, keep in mind that the size of those groups helps MGTOW spread.  And we constantly note how the subscriber count for this group keeps automatically going up, with not really much organized marketing of the idea.  I think that some people have even posted here that the effects of MGTOW are beginning to be noticed in places like bars.

I don't even see how MGTOW stops spreading.  The trend in society is to NOT do anything for men, it seems like.  So I can't imagine there will be any attempt to address MGTOW until it's really widespread.  And how would you even fix it?  We can come up with theoretical ideas that might help fix dating and romantic relationships, but we can't even get affordable health insurance for everyone in the United States -- the idea that dating will be ""fixed"" just doesn't seem believable.

The bottom line is that the romantic relationship world just doesn't seem to care about most guys these days.  So it's not like those guys are going to feel like they are missing out, by walking away from dating.  In return, they get more freedom to make their own decisions, more money to spend on themselves, peace and quiet, and so on -- potentially a significant improvement in the quality of their lives.

Somewhere along the line, it seems like society just figured that guys could never walk away from dating, no matter how badly or unfairly they got treated by their experiences.  Well, sure enough, that was an incorrect assumption.  I don't care who it is, you can't just treat most normal people badly, not offer much in return to many of them, and then expect them to stick around.

Maybe some of those people really don't like guys, and will be happy if a lot of guys go MGTOW.  But I have to wonder if some will question if society really screwed up, if we get to the point where most people don't have serious romantic relationships anymore.  The thing is, I don't know how you could ever turn it around, especially at that point.

e2pkkzm,"Ok, this may even need the moderators to step in and edit some of the comments because this the original poster is flat out wrong, and meaningfully so in a way that twists the narrative in a way that damages men.  Firstly, there are no means and variance posted, but let's assume these are normal distributions centered around 100 (in IQ fashion).

Let X be a random variable for the IQ of men, and let Y be a random variable for the IQ of women.  

You are either claiming that the 50th percentile woman is smarter than the 50th percentile man or that if you picked a random woman and a random man that the probability that the random woman would be smarter than the random man is greater than 50%.

Well, if we have normal distributions with the same mean, then the 50th percentile male and woman will have the same IQ, but I don't think that's your claim.  I think you're claiming that P(X &lt Y) &gt 50%.

So here we go,

Let X and Y be independent and normally distributed with mean = 100 and some Var(X) and Var(Y)

P(X &lt Y) = P (X - Y &lt 0)

Because X, Y are independent normal, the random variable (X-Y) is normally distributed with mean = (100-100) = 0 and Var (X-Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y).

So the rest is trivial.  P(X - Y) &lt 0 when X-Y is normally distributed with mean 0 and Var(X-Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) is EXACTLY FIFTY PERCENT.  It's a crapshoot.

If you want your claim to be right, then you need to find studies where the mean for women is higher than the mean for men, and meaningfully different - in order to account for random chance.  And  I've seen studies where the men were slightly higher, but again, probably not enough to be meaningful to make a claim along the lines of pick a random man/woman and who is smarter.

And the refutations that you guys are trying to make about it show as much hamstering as a typical woman.  

IT'S A FUCKING MATH CLAIM.  REFUTE HIS ARGUMENT WITH A MATH PROOF, not with feels and ad hominem.  I'm 2 decades away from this stuff and rusty as hell, and I could still cobble together something to trash it.  You young guys should have stomped all over this.

I think that a lot of guys on this group start off wanting exactly that.  It would be nice if the world actually worked like that for everyone.  I tried to find a partner for years and years, and I walked away from all that after just getting tired of searching.  So much of it is pointless, for many guys, in my opinion.  For example, some women will rule out a guy over things he has no control over.  Or the guy is expected to buy an expensive car, a huge house, train in the gym for hours each week of extra time that he really doesn't have, just to date a woman that he is barely attracted to.  Then divorce can be a disaster, and the divorce rate is so high that, if one is going to be realistic with themselves, there is the question of whether their marriage will last in today's environment.

Why are you ""backpedaling"" now?  This is just trying to throw camouflage over your crimes and the crimes of your collective.  You're just like you've always been, a hate filled misandrist, supporting the evil people you are now pretending to not be part of.

e2pmt2t,"Why don't you start a divorce insurance business? See how quickly you go bankrupt.

Car/home insurance companies work because most people don't make huge claims. Very rarely does a car accident incur tens of thousands of pounds in damages, so on the whole,  most customers pay more into their  insurance than they'll ever get out. That makes the company a profit. They are able identify high and low risk customers based on their experience/history etc, so can calculate premiums accordingly (or refuse cover altogether).

With divorce rates so high, and court fees/alimony reaching retarded levels, how much will the Average Joe have to pay in annual premiums for the company to still stay in profit after a huge payout? How do you identify high risk and low risk customers? Divorces happen frequently and (to the outside observer) almost at random. Seemingly happy coupes can suddenly break down, while shitty couples stay together forever. Theres no way to know who is and isnt high risk. 

How can a company like that operate? They either charge everyone huge premiums which most cant/wont afford, or offer low price premiums which won't keep them in the black when 50% of the  customers make huge claims that far outweigh the revenue brought in by the customers who don't claim?
